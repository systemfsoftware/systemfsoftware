/**
 * Verifies a missing transitive dependency of the upstream is reported as that
 * dependency's failure, not as candidate absence.
 *
 * Pins the resolve-then-execute split in `tryRequire`: the candidate itself
 * resolves, so a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` raised while its body `require`s an absent
 * dependency must surface that dependency, never be misclassified as the
 * candidate being uninstalled. Run through the production loader with a real
 * module on disk whose `require` target does not exist.
 *
 * 1. Point `upstreamTransformer` at a module that requires an absent dependency.
 * 2. Resolve it through the real loader.
 * 3. Assert the diagnostic names the missing dependency, not the "could not load"
 *    absence message.
