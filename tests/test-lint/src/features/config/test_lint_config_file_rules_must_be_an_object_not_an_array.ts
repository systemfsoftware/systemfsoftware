/**
 * Verifies that a config file whose `rules` is an array, not a severity map, is
 * rejected with a typed error.
 *
 * `rules` is the central field of the `lint.config.*` model; its contract is a
 * severity map keyed by rule name. An array would let the user's intent drop
 * silently as the sidecar iterates entries no rule name reaches, so the loader
 * rejects the wrong shape loudly. This restores the coverage of an equivalent
 * test that exercised the now-withdrawn inline-config model.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a fixture with a discovered `lint.config.json` whose `rules` is
 *    `["no-var"]` — an array instead of a map.
 * 2. Run ttsc.
 * 3. Assert non-zero exit and stderr says the rules value must be a severity map.
