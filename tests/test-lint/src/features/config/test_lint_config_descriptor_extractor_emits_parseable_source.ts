/**
 * Verifies the descriptor extractor is emitted as source that can parse.
 *
 * Three loaders are generated from literals, and the two on the Go side are
 * already checked at their generators. This one is the most dangerous of the
 * three and was the only one unchecked: it lives inside a template literal, so
 * the template consumes its own escapes before anything is emitted, and a
 * dropped backslash there turns an escape into the character it was escaping —
 * a real newline or a NUL inside a JavaScript string. That produces source
 * which does not parse and takes every descriptor load with it, the same defect
 * that already shipped once on the Go side and was caught only by review.
 *
 * The emitted string is what is inspected, not this repository's text. Reading
 * the source file would check characters no consumer ever executes, and the
 * defect this exists for is invisible there.
 *
 * 1. Take the extractor's emitted source.
 * 2. Assert no line leaves a string literal open, and none carries a control
 *    character a string cannot hold.
 * 3. Assert the placeholders the caller substitutes survive.
