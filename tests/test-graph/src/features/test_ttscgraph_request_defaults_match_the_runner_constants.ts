/**
 * Verifies each request default the MCP schema publishes is the one the runner
 * applies.
 *
 * The default is written twice — as a JSDoc `@default` typia turns into the
 * tool schema, and as the runner's fallback constant — and the two drifted
 * apart twice, in the same way both times: a commit raised the constant for a
 * benchmark result and left the tag behind. `details.dependencyLimit` said 1
 * and gave 2 (`77dc14d04`), `tour.limit` said 4 and gave 5 (`c5243ad1c`). The
 * schema is the only description of these knobs a model ever reads, so a stale
 * tag is the graph telling the caller something the graph does not do — the
 * same shape as #732, arriving through the request contract instead of the
 * result. Neither drift was visible to anything that runs.
 *
 * This is the gate the pair needs, mirroring the one that holds the dump schema
 * version to its TypeScript reader. Whichever side moves, the other has to
 * follow, and the test says which.
 *
 * 1. Read each structure file and its runner.
 * 2. Extract the documented `@default` and the runner's constant.
 * 3. Assert they agree.
