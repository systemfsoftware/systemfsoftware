/**
 * Verifies a documentation link is a traversable relation under the full focus
 * and under neither of the narrowed ones.
 *
 * A `{@link}` the checker resolves is a compiler fact, so it belongs in the
 * graph — but it is neither execution nor a type position, and a consumer that
 * asked for one of those and received a documentation mention would be told a
 * flow runs through prose. The narrowed focuses are therefore the load-bearing
 * assertions here: the positive one only proves the edge exists.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a project whose function cites a type in documentation, calls
 *    another function, and names a third type in its signature.
 * 2. Trace it under each focus.
 * 3. Assert the documentation target is reached under `all` only, while the call
 *    and the type reference keep their own focuses, that `details` reports the
 *    link as its own relation rather than folding it into calls or types, and
 *    that neither bounded operation carries a tag.
