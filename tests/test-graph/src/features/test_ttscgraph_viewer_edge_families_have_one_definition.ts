/**
 * Verifies graph viewer: one definition of the edge families.
 *
 * The vocabulary lived in five unenforced places — a display map copied into
 * three reducers, a colour map in each viewer, and a legend written out by hand
 * in `packages/graph/src/viewer/index.html`. `doc_ref` shipped with no legend
 * entry, and `exports` was drawn in the fallback colour under no legend entry
 * and no filter row at all. This case makes the next family impossible to
 * half-add.
 *
 * 1. Reduce a dump carrying one edge of every kind a dump can hold, through all
 *    three reducer copies, and require them to fold it identically.
 * 2. Require each copy's display map to name every one of those kinds, because a
 *    fold onto a family of the same name changes nothing when deleted.
 * 3. Require every family to have a colour in both viewers and a label on the
 *    website, and an unknown kind to still pass through with none.
 * 4. Render the legend and require one entry per family, in order, with the right
 *    swatch — and require the markup to build no entry of its own.
