/**
 * Verifies each operation's `audit` matches how its result was actually
 * selected: the ranked shortlists (`lookup`, `entrypoints`, `tour`) declare the
 * selection audit, the walks from a named handle (`trace`, `overview`) declare
 * the strong fact-verification audit, and `details` declares its own — its
 * result is a complete identity plus a fan-out slice, not one bounded whole.
 *
 * One global audit used to claim every result contained nothing "matched,
 * ranked, guessed, or inferred," was complete, and should not prompt a second
 * call — false for the operations whose purpose is to score, rank, cap per
 * file, and truncate a shortlist against a natural-language question. The
 * compiler can verify each returned fact, but not that a heuristic shortlist
 * covers the question, so telling the caller to stop conflated two guarantees.
 * This case pins each operation's audit to its real selection path, on results
 * that are non-empty, ranked, and truncated, so the two audits cannot drift
 * back into one.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a project where one helper is reached from many exported
 *    handlers, so a broad query yields a ranked, bounded, truncated shortlist.
 * 2. Drive every request branch over MCP.
 * 3. Assert the ranked branches carry {@link RESULT_AUDIT_SELECTION} plus the
 *    ranking/truncation metadata that justifies it, `trace` and `overview`
 *    carry {@link RESULT_AUDIT}, `details` carries {@link RESULT_AUDIT_DETAILS},
 *    and the audits are distinct.
