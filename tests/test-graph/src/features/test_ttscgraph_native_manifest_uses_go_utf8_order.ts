 * UTF-16 code units. A BMP private-use key and a supplementary key reverse
 * those orders, so this pair pins the cross-language protocol comparator.
 *
 * 1. Publish two valid empty shards sorted by the Go producer.
 * 2. Place U+E000 before U+10000 in that manifest.
 * 3. Accept the generation without treating the valid order as malformed.
