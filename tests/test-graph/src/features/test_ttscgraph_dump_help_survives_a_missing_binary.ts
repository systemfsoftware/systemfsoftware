/**
 * Verifies `dump --help` still answers when the native binary cannot be found.
 *
 * `dump` forwards every flag to `ttscgraph`, which owns the contract and
 * answers `--help` itself. When no platform package is installed the launcher
 * used to fail resolution first, so the one command that could tell a caller
 * what to install was reachable only by callers who had already installed it.
 * The fallback must stay a fallback: an ordinary `dump` with no binary is still
 * an error, and a resolvable binary must keep owning help.
 *
 * 1. Run from an empty project with no resolvable binary and no override.
 * 2. Assert every help spelling exits 0 with usage naming the native authority.
 * 3. Assert an ordinary `dump` still fails, and that a resolvable binary receives
 *    `--help` instead of the launcher answering for it.
