/**
 * Verifies `details` returns a symbol's whole identity and only a slice of its
 * fan-out.
 *
 * The caller named the handle to learn what it is, so its identity — a class's
 * members, a union's values — is the answer and is not sampled: cut it and the
 * model reads the file for the rest, the read this index exists to remove. Its
 * fan-out is a different thing. What names or uses a symbol grows with the
 * symbol's popularity, not with the symbol, so a central type answers with a
 * thousand "who uses me" refs — a hundred thousand tokens of trace/impact in a
 * single "what is this" call. So identity is uncapped and fan-out is a small
 * orientation slice, measured on real repositories: an uncapped `DataSource`
 * came back 390 KB, of which 380 KB was its 1060 type-references.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a class of 20 members and a union of 20 literals, plus 20
 *    functions that all reference the class in a parameter type.
 * 2. Ask `details` for the class (with neighbors) and the union.
 * 3. Assert every member and value comes back, and that the 20 inbound references
 *    are capped to the fan-out slice.
