/**
 * Verifies a generation proves each shared derived input once, not per module.
 *
 * Pins samchon/ttsc#1222. Real programs give every module the same reachable
 * closure and the same `graph.globals`, so a persistent host that re-read each
 * delivered file's inputs multiplied one generation's proven bytes by the
 * module count; the partitioned fixture used by the neighbouring
 * per-file-inputs test cannot observe that. An unchanged metadata signature
 * must stand in for the content comparison without loosening any invalidation.
 *
 * 1. Replay a shared graph closure with global-scope declarations, one of them
 *    reported under two spellings, and assert per-module reads stay bounded.
 * 2. Touch one global: the generation survives, the content comparison runs once,
 *    and later deliveries stop re-reading it.
 * 3. Edit a global, a reachable external, project membership, and a reachable
 *    project source, and assert each replaces the generation.
