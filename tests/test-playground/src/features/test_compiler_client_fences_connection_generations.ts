/**
 * Verifies playground compiler client: fences overlapping connection
 * generations.
 *
 * A reset invalidates its generation before awaiting connection settlement. A
 * replacement that resolves or becomes current while that cleanup is pending
 * must remain cached and reachable; otherwise a wasm Worker leaks and a later
 * retry allocates a duplicate connection.
 *
 * 1. Settle replacement B before original A, then settle and reject A in separate
 *    orderings while resets overlap both attempts.
 * 2. Assert each invalidated connector closes exactly once and B remains the
 *    shared cached connection until its own reset.
