/**
 * Verifies a project emitting in place still watches its declared inputs.
 *
 * Compiler outputs are excluded from the project-input lane so a build cannot
 * feed its own rebuild. That exclusion reads the configured output directory,
 * and a project may configure it as the project itself — emitting beside the
 * sources is an ordinary layout, and `outDir` set to the project directory says
 * exactly that. Honouring it literally makes every declared input a build
 * product, so nothing is watched and nothing reports it: the build keeps
 * succeeding and simply stops reacting.
 *
 * Watching is the safe side of this one. A product that gets watched costs a
 * spare rebuild; an input that does not is never seen again.
 *
 * 1. Configure a project whose output directory is the project itself.
 * 2. Declare an input inside it.
 * 3. Assert the input is still watched and its edit is still reported.
