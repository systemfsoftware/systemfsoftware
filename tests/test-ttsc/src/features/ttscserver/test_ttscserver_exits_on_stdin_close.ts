 * sending a proper shutdown sequence.
 *
 * Editors crash or get killed; the LSP host must not deadlock waiting for
 * shutdown notifications that will never arrive. This pins the
 * internal/lspserver proxy fallback that closes the upstream pipe on editor
 * EOF, which in turn lets the upstream tsgo process drain.
 *
 * 1. Spawn ttscserver.
 * 2. Close stdin immediately (no initialize, no shutdown).
 * 3. Assert exit code 0.
