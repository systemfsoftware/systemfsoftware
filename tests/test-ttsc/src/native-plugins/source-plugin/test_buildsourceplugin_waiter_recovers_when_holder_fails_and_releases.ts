/**
 * Verifies buildSourcePlugin waiter recovers when the holder fails and
 * releases.
 *
 * End-to-end pin for issue #421: a holder whose `go build` throws releases the
 * generation in its `finally`, and the waiting process then observes no
 * `current` generation. The old inspector classified that release as an
 * infinitely old abandoned legacy lock and printed `reclaiming abandoned ...
 * Infinitym NaNs old`. The waiter must instead treat the free key as a routine
 * handoff: reacquire it, run the build itself, and publish the one usable
 * binary. Sequencing uses explicit file barriers produced by the fake
 * toolchain, never sleeps — every interleaving must satisfy the assertions.
 *
 * 1. Start a holder worker whose fake `go build` writes a barrier file, then
 *    blocks until released, then exits non-zero.
 * 2. After the barrier exists, start a waiter worker on the same cache key and
 *    release the holder once the waiter's fake-go invocation log shows it
 *    passed its pre-lock toolchain probes.
 * 3. Assert the holder exits 1 without publishing while the waiter exits 0, runs
 *    its own `go build`, and publishes the binary.
 * 4. Assert the waiter's stderr never reports reclaiming an abandoned lock and
 *    never contains the `Infinitym NaNs` malformation.
