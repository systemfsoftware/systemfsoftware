/**
 * Verifies buildSourcePlugin waiter reuses the binary a holder publishes as it
 * releases.
 *
 * Companion pin for issue #421's success-side race: the holder publishes the
 * binary and retires its generation while the waiter is between observations.
 * Whatever the interleaving — the waiter sees the binary directly, or first
 * sees the released generation and re-checks — it must reuse the binary, never
 * rebuild it and never report the routine release as reclaiming an abandoned
 * lock.
 *
 * 1. Start a holder worker whose fake `go build` writes a barrier file and blocks;
 *    start a waiter on the same cache key once the barrier exists.
 * 2. Release the holder after the waiter's fake-go invocation log shows it passed
 *    its pre-lock toolchain probes; the holder publishes and exits 0.
 * 3. Assert both workers exit 0 and print the same binary path.
 * 4. Assert the waiter never ran `go build`, never printed the cold-build banner,
 *    and never reported an abandoned lock.
