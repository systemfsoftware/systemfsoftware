/**
 * Verifies isolation never severs a thread that already exists.
 *
 * A Codex home is not only configuration. The rollout a resume replays and the
 * Goal state the runner reconciles against both live inside it, in separate
 * stores, and neither can be read from anywhere else. So handing a run that
 * already owns a thread a fresh directory does not isolate that run, it ends
 * it: the resume asks for a thread that, from where it now stands, was never
 * created.
 *
 * Isolation arrived mid-cohort and did exactly that. The first cell resumed
 * after it stopped with `no rollout found for thread id`; seeding the rollout
 * by hand moved the failure to `Retained state has no exact empty Goal
 * boundary`, because the Goal store is a different file and was equally empty.
 * Both symptoms, one cause, and the run was two objectives from finishing.
 *
 * 1. A run with no retained session is isolated, whether or not it is a fork.
 * 2. A run that already owns a thread, and has no isolated home of its own, keeps
 *    the home that thread lives in.
 * 3. A run that already owns a thread and does have an isolated home keeps that
 *    one, so isolation survives every resume after the first.
