/**
 * Verifies every backend claim owes its units in the Program that compiles it,
 * and that its operation claim enumerates the SDK through the workspace link.
 *
 * A claim populates only from the Program that owns its hosts, so a claim is
 * proved by the gate that builds that Program and by no other. Which
 * configuration declares which claim is a template decision that has already
 * moved once, so the case discovers the configurations and asks each one's own
 * gate; naming them would keep it passing after the next move while covering
 * less than it did before.
 *
 * The operation reference is the sharper edge. It selects the generated
 * accessor surface out of an installed `package`, and a workspace dependency is
 * a link — pnpm writes a junction on Windows. Enumerating that link with a
 * walker that treats it as a plain entry returns nothing, and a reference that
 * selects nothing reports full coverage of work no one did. The scaffold test
 * already cites the one published operation, so this case takes that citation
 * away: the accessor then has to be demanded by name, which an empty population
 * can never do.
 *
 * 1. Build the workspace, then open every backend claim at once.
 * 2. Remove the scaffold's citations so nothing is acknowledged.
 * 3. Run both Programs' gates and read the obligations each reported.
 * 4. Assert the package claims hold in both, that `backend-tests` holds only where
 *    its hosts live, and that its operation obligations are exactly the
 *    accessors the generator published.
