/**
 * Verifies a stage log two drivers wrote is still priced, and only when it
 * reconciles.
 *
 * A resumed thread can end up with two native processes appending to one stage
 * log, each advancing its own cumulative counter. The interleaved lines report
 * totals the walk has already passed, or steps that do not match the request
 * they carry, and abandoning the run over one of them threw away the price of a
 * cohort's largest cell while its token count stayed published. Dropping such a
 * line loses no money, because pricing is per token rather than per request and
 * the reconciliation against the retained total still has to hold exactly.
 *
 * What a drop does cost is resolution: a request whose only record went is
 * priced inside the following step instead of on its own, so the request counts
 * are a lower bound and `replayedUpdates` says so.
 *
 * 1. Price a clean single-writer log and keep the amount.
 * 2. Price the same requests with a second writer's replays interleaved, and
 *    assert the amount is identical and the drops are counted.
 * 3. Drop a request from the log entirely and assert the run is refused, since a
 *    walk that no longer reconciles is not a measurement.
