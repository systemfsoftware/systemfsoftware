/**
 * Verifies every staged backend claim really activates when its marker is
 * removed, one layer at a time.
 *
 * Deleting `disabled` is the Evidence arm's one prescribed edit to a frozen
 * configuration, and it is the moment the treatment either starts working or
 * silently stops existing. A claim that goes quiet when enabled looks exactly
 * like a claim that is satisfied: both exit zero. That is how a `package`
 * reference walking a pnpm junction as a plain entry voided a cohort — every
 * population came back empty, and an empty population demands nothing. So each
 * step asserts the claim demanded something, against a workspace that
 * acknowledges nothing at all: the layers written here carry no citation, and
 * the one citation the overlay ships is removed first.
 *
 * Claim-level activation alone would not have caught that cohort's defect. The
 * claim reaching the installed SDK also references the delivered requirements,
 * and that reference stays healthy, so the claim keeps reporting and keeps
 * looking active while the population reached through the install is empty.
 * Every claim declaring a `package` reference is therefore held to naming each
 * accessor the generator published.
 *
 * The order is read from the instruction the measured agent receives rather
 * than fixed here, because the order is a real property of the graph: a claim
 * enabled before the layer it references exists selects nothing.
 *
 * 1. Build the workspace far enough that every claim's population can exist.
 * 2. Assert every declared claim ships staged, with a comment naming its layer.
 * 3. For each claim in the instructed order, write its host layer, delete its
 *    marker, and run the gate that compiles the Program owning its hosts.
 * 4. Assert the claim reported obligations, that its requirement reference reached
 *    every delivered document declaring a section, and that a package reference
 *    owed every published accessor.
