/**
 * Verifies the packaged rule accepts a merged identity documented at its first
 * declaration.
 *
 * This is the idiom a consumer meets first, and the one `evidence/singular`
 * blesses by name. Each fixture reaches its first declaration through a
 * different route — an interface founding a type family, a class founding a
 * merged class identity, an overload run, a variable statement behind a default
 * export — and two of them document every half, since nothing beyond the first
 * is asked for or objected to. Driving that through the real binary is what
 * proves the agreement between the two rules survives packaging.
 *
 * A clean exit would not distinguish "every identity is documented" from "the
 * rule selects nothing", so one deliberately undocumented export stands beside
 * them and the case demands the build fail naming exactly it. Any of the four
 * documented identities losing its block, or the rule narrowing what it
 * selects, moves that count.
 *
 * 1. Declare an interface, a class, an overload set, and a default export, each
 *    documented on its first declaration and some on every half, beside one
 *    export left deliberately undocumented.
 * 2. Enable `evidence/documented` with the default selection.
 * 3. Assert the build fails naming only the undocumented export.
