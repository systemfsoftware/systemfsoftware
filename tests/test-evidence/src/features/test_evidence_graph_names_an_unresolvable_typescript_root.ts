/**
 * Verifies a TypeScript claim root that does not resolve is named as a root.
 *
 * The rule computed that sentence all along and read it as a boolean, so the
 * author was answered with `matched no typescript files` and a lecture on glob
 * syntax for a mistake that is one directory name. Markdown and Prisma never
 * had the bug because their loaders walk the root; TypeScript walks nothing.
 * This runs the real binary, because the message has to survive the native
 * boundary the same way the reference-policy diagnostics do.
 *
 * 1. Declare a TypeScript claim rooted at a sibling directory that is absent.
 * 2. Run `ttsc check`.
 * 3. Assert the root is named and no glob diagnostic accompanies it.
