# @ttsc/unplugin experimental install test

This experiment installs packed `ttsc`, the current platform package, and `@ttsc/unplugin` into a clean consumer project.

It verifies ESM and CJS entrypoints, production builds, and dependency updates in every supported host. Node, Go, and Bun must be available on PATH. CI pins Bun and every installed ecosystem version.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm run experimental:unplugin
```

To reuse already-built tarballs:

```bash
pnpm --dir experimental/test-unplugin start -- --skip-pack
```

The consumer installs once. Every scenario shares the same immutable Go plugin source and native build cache, while mutable projects remain separate. The contract checks transformed output and compilation counts instead of imposing machine-dependent speed thresholds. Successful asynchronous checks proceed on build events or observed state; deadlines only bound failures.

| Host | Direct contract |
| --- | --- |
| Vite 7 and 8 | Client/SSR dependency invalidation, runtime-import isolation, initial failure and rebuild recovery, restart |
| React Router 8 | Its actual Vite plugin accepts erased `.server` type imports, refreshes consumers and recovers from failed transforms |
| Rollup and Rolldown | Initial failure delivery, watch rebuilds and later failure/recovery through compiler-only edits |
| esbuild | Watch context, initial failure and rebuild recovery, unchanged rebuild, disposal |
| webpack and Rspack | Module-owned dependency rebuilds, initial failure and rebuild recovery, cache reuse, compiler shutdown and replacement |
| Farm | Native dependency registration, repeated failed/repaired `Compiler.update` calls, unchanged reuse, replacement after failed initial compilation |
| Next.js | Production and development with webpack and Turbopack, HTTP failure/recovery and unchanged requests |
| Bun | Repeated builds with failed/repaired inputs and fresh runtime preload sessions after an error |

The installed package's export map must match this executable host inventory. Adding an adapter without a direct contract fails the rehearsal. Core graph/proof scenarios remain in `tests/test-unplugin`; its real Bun and Vite boundary cases also run in the Windows lane. Long-lived Next development CLIs run in owned process trees and are stopped after their HTTP assertions.

Rollup's initial-error check uses its one-shot API before reusing the plugin in a watcher. Its watch API emits the first error before its filesystem subscriptions are ready and can miss an immediate repair even with a plain native plugin. Later error/recovery transitions run through the live watcher. Farm's initial compilation failure requires a replacement compiler through its public API; incremental failures recover in the same compiler.
