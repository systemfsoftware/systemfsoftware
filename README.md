A `typescript-go` toolchain for compiler-powered plugins and type-safe execution.

- **`ttsc`**: build, check, and transform.
- **`ttsx`**: execute TypeScript with type checking.
- [**`@ttsc/lint`**](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/tree/master/packages/lint): lint violations as compiler errors.
- [**`@ttsc/evidence`**](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/tree/master/packages/evidence): 100% requirement coverage, or the build fails.
- [**`@ttsc/graph`**](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/tree/master/packages/graph): compiler knowledge graph that cuts agent tokens by 92%.
- **plugin support**: compiler-powered libraries, such as `typia`.

## Setup

`ttsc` is a drop-in replacement for `tsc`. It reads the same `tsconfig.json`, takes the same flags, and emits the same JavaScript, then runs your plugins in the pass that type-checks the project.

```bash
npm install -D ttsc typescript
```

```bash
npx ttsx src/index.ts   # run a file, type-checked first
npx ttsc                # build
npx ttsc --noEmit       # check only
npx ttsc --watch        # rebuild on save
```

`ttsx` runs a file the way `tsx` or `ts-node` does, but it type-checks the whole project first, so a type error stops the run before anything executes.

Preload the same checked runtime when Node or a test runner owns the process:

```bash
node --require ttsc/register src/index.ts
mocha --require ttsc/register --extension ts,tsx "test/**/*.ts"
```

`ttsc/register` discovers the nearest `tsconfig.json` for each TypeScript root, applies its plugins, and refuses to execute when the project does not type-check.

That covers the CLI. The integrations each have a short guide:

- [`@ttsc/unplugin`](https://ttsc.dev/docs/setup/unplugin): Vite, Rollup, Rolldown, esbuild, webpack, Rspack, Next.js, Turbopack, Farm, and Bun.
- [`@ttsc/metro`](https://ttsc.dev/docs/setup/metro): React Native and Expo.
- [`@ttsc/vscode`](https://ttsc.dev/docs/setup/vscode): live editor diagnostics.

## Lint

Lint and format inside the type-check you already run. 720+ rules across 21 families, plus a formatter whose rules are ported from Prettier 3.8.3 — see the [format guide](https://ttsc.dev/docs/lint/format) for the shapes it covers and the ones it leaves alone.

```ts
// src/index.ts
var x: number = 3;
let y: number = 4;
const z: string = 5;
```

```bash
$ npx ttsc --noEmit
src/index.ts:3:7 - error TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.

3 const z: string = 5;
        ~

src/index.ts:2:5 - error TS17397: [prefer-const] Use const instead of let.

2 let y: number = 4;
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

src/index.ts:1:1 - error TS11966: [no-var] Unexpected var, use let or const instead.

1 var x: number = 3;
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Found 3 errors in the same file, starting at: src/index.ts:3
```

Type errors and lint violations arrive in one stream, so the CI step that already runs `ttsc --noEmit` gates lint with no second job and no second parse. On vscode's 6,093 files the rules take 73 ms inside that check, where ESLint spends 66.7 s as its own command.

`npx ttsc fix` applies autofixes and formatting; `npx ttsc format` only formats. Rules and every `format` key are in the [Lint and Format guide](https://ttsc.dev/docs/lint).

## Evidence Graph

Your spec becomes a compile error, so requirement coverage is 100% or the build does not pass. An agent can still lie, but it cannot lie by omission.

```tsx
/**
 * @evidence docs/discount.md#coupon-stacking
 *           States the per-issuer stacking limit
 *           this section defines, in the buyer's words.
 * @evidence POST:/orders/{orderId}/coupons
 *           Explains the rejection this endpoint returns
 *           for an over-stacked coupon set.
 * @evidence {@link hooks.useCouponStacking} Renders the limit this hook resolves.
 */
export function CouponStackingNotice(props: IProps): JSX.Element;
```

`@evidence <target> <reason>` names one unit of the spec and why this declaration answers for it. A target is a document section, an API operation, a database schema model, or a TypeScript symbol as an inline link.

```bash
$ npx ttsc
error TS16411: [evidence/graph] Missing acknowledgement for 'docs/discount.md#coupon-stacking'
  (Markdown H2 'Coupon Stacking' at docs/discount.md:3)
  in Claim 1 reference 1 (markdown, symbols: h2, h3).

  Cite the artifact that answers for this unit with @evidence on a selected
  typescript host, building that artifact first when none does, or write
  @evidenceExclude on an eligible carrier when nothing here owes it. Never
  leave an untrue tag standing just to pass this check; it removes the error,
  not the problem.

Found 3 errors.
```

Without those tags, the build fails once per obligation, because one reference never covers another. An AI coding agent has to clear them to finish, and clearing them means citing each target and writing down why its code answers for it.

## Compiler Knowledge Graph

Your coding agent answers from the compiler instead of grepping and re-reading files.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ttsc-graph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ttsc/graph"]
    }
  }
}
```

One typed MCP tool over a graph the type checker resolved: what calls what, what a change would touch, where to start reading. Answers carry names, signatures, edges, and spans, never file bodies, so a large repository cannot inflate the response.

Across 64 measured question and model pairs, the median answer costs 92% fewer tokens and 95% fewer tool calls than the same agent with no MCP. The design and the comparators are in [`@ttsc/graph`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/tree/master/packages/graph).

## Plugins

A plugin hooks the compile to add checks, transforms, or type-driven code generation, all driven by the types the checker has already resolved. It runs on every `ttsc` build and `ttsx` run, with no extra step.

[typia](https://typia.io) is the canonical one. Ask it for a validator of any type, and the transform writes the implementation at build time:

```ts
import typia from "typia";

export const isStringArray = typia.createIs<string[]>();
```

No schema, no decorator. The call compiles to a plain function:

```js
export const isStringArray = (() => {
  return (input) =>
    Array.isArray(input) && input.every((elem) => "string" === typeof elem);
})();
```
