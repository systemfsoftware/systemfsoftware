// TestAllRuleNamesIsSorted verifies that AllRuleNames returns rule names in lexicographic
// order and that the set contains the headline rules advertised in the README.
//
// The rule list is consumed by documentation generators, diagnostic formatters, and
// anywhere the registry is iterated. An unsorted list produces non-deterministic output
// that changes each time a rule is added. Sorting at registration time, rather than at
// call time, is a performance choice that must be validated here. The headline check
// confirms that registration wiring is not accidentally excluded from a build tag.
//
// 1. Call AllRuleNames() and build a sorted copy of the result.
// 2. Compare element by element; fail on the first mismatch.
// 3. Verify that no-var, typescript/no-explicit-any, typescript/no-non-null-assertion, and eqeqeq are present.
