// Idempotence is mandatory: any rule whose second pass re-reports its own
// previous edit would spin the format loop until the per-run cap. The
// fastest regression mode here would be a one-character change that ignored
// the raw[0] guard and walked a double-quoted literal as if it were single
// — this scenario pins that guard.

// 1. Parse a source file with only double-quoted literals.
// 2. Run the engine with formatQuotes enabled.
