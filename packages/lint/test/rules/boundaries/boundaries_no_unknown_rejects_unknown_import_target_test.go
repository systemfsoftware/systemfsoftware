// This covers the progressive-adoption guard: projects can declare the element
// graph they care about and then detect dependencies that fall outside that
// graph without enabling file-wide unknown checks yet.
//
// 1. Materialize an app source file and a shared utility file.
// 2. Configure only app and domain source-path elements.
// 3. Assert the app import of the shared utility reports exactly one finding.
