// TestRuleCorpusNoMisleadingCharacterClass verifies the lint rule corpus fixture no-misleading-character-class.ts.
//
// Rule corpus tests mirror tests/test-lint/src/cases inside Go unit coverage. Each generated
// scenario keeps one annotated TypeScript fixture tied to the native Engine so individual rule
// Check methods are measured by go test instead of only by the TypeScript feature runner.
//
// This case enables the rule annotations declared in no-misleading-character-class.ts and
// compares normalized rule, severity, and line triples. The source text stays embedded in the
// generated Go file so the test remains package-local and deterministic.
//
// 1. Load the annotated TypeScript fixture source embedded below.
// 2. Enable the rule severities declared by its // expect: comments.
// 3. Assert the native Engine reports exactly the annotated diagnostics.
