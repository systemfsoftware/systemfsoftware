// TestUnicornPreferStringRawSkipsMultilineStringLiterals verifies the rule
// stays silent on a string literal continued onto a second line.
//
// Pins upstream's `start.line !== end.line` guard. A string literal reaches a
// second line only through a line continuation, whose backslash-newline pair
// the parser swallows; inside a `String.raw` template both characters would
// survive, so the value gains a backslash and a newline. Both line endings are
// covered because a CRLF checkout must not decide whether the rule fires.
//
//  1. Enable unicorn/prefer-string-raw on a fixture whose annotated line holds
//     a single-line path.
//  2. Continue the same path across a line break, once with LF and once with
//     CRLF.
//  3. Assert the annotated line is the ONLY finding in either file.
