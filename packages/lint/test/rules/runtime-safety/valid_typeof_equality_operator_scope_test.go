// TestValidTypeofEqualityOperatorScope verifies valid-typeof reports only across
// the four equality operators while its comparison-operator peers keep the
// relational ones.
//
// Upstream valid-typeof gates on OPERATORS = {==, ===, !=, !==}: a relational
// comparison orders two strings rather than naming a type, so `typeof x < "m"`
// is not a mistyped type name and ESLint stays silent. This port used to gate on
// the shared isComparisonOperator, which also admits <, >, <= and >=, and
// reported there. Both halves of the fix need pinning: the equality arm must
// still catch every typo shape (either operand order, parentheses, static
// template literal), and use-isnan, no-self-compare, no-compare-neg-zero and
// yoda — whose upstream operator sets do span ordering — must still report on
// relational operators, proving the shared predicate was not narrowed under them.
//
//  1. Wrap the comparison under test as the sole expression of a two-parameter
//     function, so every finding lands on line 2.
//  2. Run the single rule the case names through the native engine.
//  3. Compare normalized rule/severity/line findings against the expectation,
//     requiring zero findings for the arms upstream leaves silent.
