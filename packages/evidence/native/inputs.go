// ProjectInputs declares the files this rule reads from outside the Program.
//
// Markdown, Prisma, and Swagger evidence never enters the TypeScript Program,
// so until `@ttsc/lint@0.22.0` shipped this contract the host had no way to
// learn that the graph depended on them. The resulting asymmetry was invisible
// rather than merely inconvenient: a developer editing code saw fresh
// diagnostics, because the TypeScript event drove a cycle that reloaded the
// documents along with it, while a developer editing only a spec section or a
// schema saw the citation that had just gone stale keep reporting green.
//
// The host calls this after resolving options and project identity but before
// loading a Program, so nothing here may read `ctx.Sources`, and nothing here
// may touch the filesystem — this declares configured topology rather than the
// files a successful load happened to reach.

// watches, so declaring them again would ask for a second watcher on a file
// that already has one.

// globInputs publishes the positive half of one glob set, anchored on the root

//
// Exclusions are dropped rather than translated, because the host's dependency
// model has no negation — declaring `!docs/private/**` as a glob would watch
// precisely the documents this graph refuses to read. What is left over-selects
// slightly, and that is the safe direction: a spurious rebuild costs one cycle,
// while a missing one leaves a stale citation reporting green, which is the
// whole failure this contract exists to remove.
//
// The declared pattern is the compiled segment form rather than `Raw`, so the
// host receives a pattern with the exclusion marker already stripped, `\`
// already normalized to `/`, and a leading `./` already gone.
//
// The root is prefixed as the author wrote it rather than resolved here. The
// host anchors a relative pattern against the same physical project root this
// rule uses (`linthost/project_inputs.go:151-171`), and it accepts one that
// ascends or is absolute — so `../../docs/**/*.md` and `C:/shared/docs/**/*.md`
// both arrive at the directory `Check` will read. Resolving it here would
// duplicate that arithmetic and make this contract depend on a project identity
// it is supposed to be able to answer without.

// Withholding the URL form is not a shortcut. The host rejects a remote pattern
// outright (`linthost/project_inputs.go:159-161`), and one rejected input
// discards the whole snapshot for every project rule in the run
// (`linthost/project_inputs.go:113-135`) — so declaring a URL here would take
// this graph's Markdown globs down with it and restore the exact blindness the
// contract removes.
//
// The boundary is also real rather than imposed: a URL has no filesystem event
// to observe, so its freshness is per-evaluation and belongs to the loader.
//
// A local path is published exactly as it normalized, including one that
// ascends out of the project or names an absolute location. The host resolves
// both against the same root this rule reads them from, so a generated document
// in a sibling package is watched on the same terms as one inside the project.
