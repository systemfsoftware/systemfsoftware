 * therefore stand for content only while a later write is guaranteed to move
 * it, and that guarantee needs a reference instant the observed filesystem
 * itself produced: once some stamp on the same device is strictly newer than an
 * input's modification stamp, that input's tick is provably over, so any later
 * write must mint a newer stamp and move the signature. That is git's
 * racily-clean index rule, adapted to a read-only contract: where git compares
 * entries against the index file's own timestamp, this floor accumulates every
 * stamp the cache-owned operations report, seeded per generation by
 * {@link mintFilesystemClockReference}.
 *
 * The process clock never participates: both sides of every comparison are
 * stamps the same filesystem clock minted, at the same granularity, so a
 * filesystem clock running behind (or ahead of) the host process changes
 * nothing.
 *
 * Accumulating observed stamps is deliberately weaker than git's own reference,
 * which is a single stamp git minted itself. A stamp this floor accepts may
 * instead have been _set_ rather than minted, and a set stamp is dangerous only
 * when it lands in the future: the floor is a maximum, so a restored past stamp
 * never raises it. One future-dated file — a stamp-preserving extraction or
 * copy from a machine whose clock ran ahead — pushes its device's floor past
 * the present and reopens the same-tick window for every other input on that
 * device until the clock catches up. A clock that jumps backwards strands the
 * floor above the present the same way, a different hazard from the constant
 * offset the paragraph above is about: an offset moves both operands together
 * and changes nothing, a jump moves only the present.
 *
 * The minted probe is not enough on its own to replace observed stamps: it
 * lands on the scratch volume, which is frequently not the inputs' volume (a
 * project on `D:` with `TEMP` on `C:`), and a probe-only floor would then
 * decline every _content_ signature, so every input carrying bytes would be
 * re-read on every delivery. A strict blocker keeps its signature either way,
 * because it proves a kind rather than content. Observed stamps keep the common
 * case working; the probe covers the case they cannot, a tree whose files were
 * all written inside one tick.
