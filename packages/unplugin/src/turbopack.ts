 * loader-shaped: pure TypeScript source in, transformed source out. Wire it per
 * extension:
 *
 * ```js
 * // next.config.mjs
 * const nextConfig = {
 *   turbopack: {
 *     rules: {
 *       "*.ts": { loaders: ["@ttsc/unplugin/turbopack"] },
 *       "*.tsx": { loaders: ["@ttsc/unplugin/turbopack"] },
 *     },
 *   },
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * Pass {@link TtscUnpluginOptions} through the rule's `options` object. The
 * loader returns the source unchanged for declaration files, `node_modules`
 * paths, and transforms that produce no change, mirroring the unplugin
 * adapters' `transformInclude` filter, since a broad rule glob routes
 * everything matching the extension through the loader.
