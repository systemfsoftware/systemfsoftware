# `@ttsc/linux-arm`

Linux arm native binaries and bundled Go compiler package for `ttsc`.

This package is normally installed as an optional dependency of `ttsc`. Application projects should install `ttsc`, not this package directly.

## ARM baseline

Every artifact in this package targets the **ARMv6** baseline. The three executables (`bin/ttsc`, `bin/ttscserver`, `bin/ttscgraph`) are cross-compiled with `GOARM=6`, and the bundled Go SDK is the `linux-armv6l` distribution, so the executables and the SDK share one minimum ARM generation. ARMv6 code runs on later ARM generations (ARMv7, ARMv8/`arm64` in 32-bit mode), so this package supports the broad npm `arm` CPU contract rather than an ARMv7-only subset.

It contains the `ttsc` platform helper, the `ttscserver` LSP wrapper, the `ttscgraph` MCP code-graph server, and the Go SDK used when `ttsc` builds Go source plugins. If your package manager skipped optional dependencies, reinstall `ttsc` with optional dependencies enabled.

## Package contents

This package intentionally ships the prebuilt `linux-arm` artifacts for `ttsc`:

- `bin/ttsc`: the native command helper.
- `bin/ttscserver`: the native language-server wrapper.
- `bin/ttscgraph`: the native MCP code-graph server (used by `@ttsc/graph`).
- `bin/go/`: a pruned Go SDK used to compile source plugins into cached plugin binaries.

Source and build entrypoint: [`packages/ttsc`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/tree/master/packages/ttsc) and [`scripts/build-platform-package.cjs`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/scripts/build-platform-package.cjs).

There is no `postinstall` download step. Supply-chain scanners may report the native executables or bundled Go SDK as opaque or obfuscated because they are not readable JavaScript source. Review the npm package metadata when triaging that finding:

```bash
npm view "@ttsc/linux-arm@<version>" dist.integrity dist.signatures dist.attestations --json
npm pack "@ttsc/linux-arm@<version>" --dry-run --json
```
