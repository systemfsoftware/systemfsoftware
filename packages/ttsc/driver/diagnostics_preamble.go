// Source-preamble correction for compiler diagnostics.
//
// ttsc injects a plugin's source preamble (e.g. @ttsc/banner's copyright block)
// at the SOURCE level: sourcePreambleFS prepends it before TypeScript-Go parses,
// so the preamble participates in comment emission, removeComments, JSDoc
// association, and `.d.ts` emit naturally. The side effect is that every
// position tsgo records — including every diagnostic's — is shifted down by the
// preamble's line count, while the file the user reads has no preamble. The
// emitted source map already undoes that shift (AdjustEmittedSourceMap); this is
// the same invariant applied to the other coordinate the user is shown.
//
// The correction lives here, at the Program boundary where the preamble is
// known, rather than in each renderer. `WritePrettyDiagnostics`, the structured
// diagnostic list the JS launcher serializes, the graph snapshot, and any future
// consumer all read a Diagnostic that is already authored-relative, so none of
// them has to remember.

// preambleView is the authored (preamble-free) view of one preamble-injected
// source file, plus the byte region the preamble occupies in the buffer tsgo
// parsed.
//
// file is a re-parse of the authored text. The diagnostic renderer reads a
// source file's FileName, Text, and ECMA line map to place a location and quote
// a code frame, and all three have to describe the text the user wrote — moving
// the position alone would still quote the preamble-bearing buffer. Re-parsing
// is what produces a line map tsgo itself computed rather than one this package
// re-derived, and it costs one parse per file that actually carries a
// diagnostic.

// on-disk file, so it stays correct whichever of the BOM or hashbang the host
// stripped before parsing, and the leading-prefix check makes the result
// self-verifying: a file the preamble was never injected into (a declaration
// file, a `.json` input, a library file) simply does not match and is reported
// as having no region.
//
// One degenerate shape is nominally off by one, matching the same allowance
// AdjustSourceMapForPreamble states: a file whose entire content is a hashbang
// with no trailing newline gets the preamble appended after an inserted newline,
// which is indistinguishable from an authored trailing newline. Only a position
// at that file's very end could differ, and such a file has no code to diagnose.

// uses for diagnostics that have no source range. It counts as an error exactly

// One consequence to know: the JS launcher recovers structured diagnostics by
// parsing rendered text, and the anchor-less form carries no `line:col` for that
// parser to match — so a preamble-region diagnostic reaches stderr and the exit
// code but not `IFailure.diagnostics`. That is the same deal every anchor-less
