/**
 * # service-runtime
 *
 * Builds the runtime surface for one registered service: state signal, sync queries with
 * `.loaded()` and `.subscribe()`, async commands, and the in-flight load registry that powers
 * dependency tracking for `.loaded()`.
 *
 * ## Mental model in one paragraph
 *
 * `query.get(input)` is a synchronous, pure read: it validates input, calls the handler against
 * current state, and returns the result immediately. It does **not** fire the query's `load` — a
 * read never starts background work. Loads fire only through `query.subscribe(...)` (reactively,
 * re-firing as tracked state changes) and `query.loaded(input)` (the "wait until fully loaded"
 * form). `.loaded()` must guarantee that **every dependency the handler transitively reads is
 * settled** before returning, even though those dependencies are not declared statically anywhere.
 * That guarantee is what the drain machinery in this file exists to provide. When a handler or load
 * body reads a *dependency* via `.get()` inside a `.loaded()` drain or a load body, that read still
 * triggers and awaits the dependency's load; a bare consumer `.get()` does not.
 *
 * ## Dependency-tracking algorithm
 *
 * `.loaded()` runs a *drain loop*:
 *
 * 1. Fire this query's own `load` and put the promise into a `LoadedSession` collector.
 * 2. Repeat:
 *    - Await everything currently in the collector with `Promise.allSettled`.
 *    - Mark those load keys as `settled` for the session.
 *    - Run the sync handler under the session as a *discovery pass*. Every sync read of a
 *      dependency query (via `ctx.self.queries.*` or `ctx.getService(...).queries.*`) consults
 *      the module-scoped `activeHandlerLoadSession`; if that dep's load is not already
 *      settled or on the ancestor chain, its promise is added to the collector.
 *    - If the discovery pass added new entries, loop again. Otherwise, exit.
 * 3. Final handler call (no session) returns the validated output.
 *
 * Inside a `load` body, `ctx.self.queries.*` are *wrapped* by {@link buildLoadWrappedQueries} so
 * the same registration happens against a load-local collector — the load promise only resolves
 * when its body **and** its own dependencies have settled. This propagates the "wait" through
 * async load bodies without needing AsyncLocalStorage.
 *
 * ## Why each piece exists
 *
 * - **{@link inFlightLoads}** dedups concurrent calls for the same `(service, query, input)` so
 *   two consumers asking for the same data share one load.
 * - **{@link LoadedSession.ancestorChain}** breaks cycles: a dep whose load key is already on the
 *   call chain is skipped (not added to any collector) so two queries that read each other do
 *   not self-deadlock.
 * - **{@link LoadedSession.settledKeys}** prevents the discovery loop from refiring already
 *   completed loads on each iteration — without it, every reread of a dep in the handler would
 *   re-trigger its load and the drain loop would never converge.
 * - **{@link MAX_DRAIN_ITERATIONS}** caps pathological cases (e.g. a handler reading a query with
 *   an ever-changing input key) so a buggy service surfaces a real error instead of hanging.
 *
 * ## Boundaries
 *
 * Cross-service `getService(...).queries.*` calls **inside a load body** are intentionally not
 * tracked into the load-local collector. Authors who need cross-service deps awaited from inside
 * a load should call `.loaded()` explicitly (e.g. `await ctx.getService(id).queries.foo
 * .loaded(input)`). Cross-service calls from a sync handler still go through the session-aware
 * path because handler reads are tracked by `activeHandlerLoadSession`, which is module-scoped
 * and stable for the duration of a sync handler call.
