# gofmt indents with tabs and this repository indents Go with two spaces, so this
# wrapper is gofmt plus one normalization pass. The pass is a lexer rather than
# `s/\t/  /g` because a tab inside a string literal is data, not layout:
# `packages/lint` implements Prettier's `useTabs` and its fixtures assert
# tab-indented output. Under the whole-file substitution this replaced, those
# fixtures could only spell the tab as a `"\t"` escape, because a literal tab in a
# raw string was silently rewritten by the repository's own format command and by
# the CI gate that compares against it, so nothing reported the corruption.
#
# Comments are matched only so that a quote inside one cannot open a literal.
# A backtick is the unbounded case: an unpaired one in a comment would open a raw
# string running to the next backtick anywhere in the file, protecting every tab
# between them. An apostrophe or a double quote is the single-line case, because
# neither of those literal arms may cross a newline. Comment tabs are still
# normalized, because gofmt owns comment layout.
