// High or critical advisories with no released fix, waived deliberately.
//
// The waiver lives here rather than in pnpm's own ignore list, and the reason is
// not that pnpm's is unreachable. Measured at the pinned pnpm 10.6.4:
// `package.json#pnpm.auditConfig.ignoreGhsas` **is** honored and does remove the
// advisory from the report's `advisories` map, while the same key in
// `pnpm-workspace.yaml` reaches nothing. But pnpm subtracts nothing from
// `metadata.vulnerabilities`, which this gate also checks, so an advisory
// ignored there disappears from the list and still fails the count with no name
// attached to explain why. Waiving here keeps one place that sees the whole
// report and says out loud what it let past.
//
// (On a machine with a newer pnpm installed globally, every command here prints
// `[WARN] The "pnpm" field in package.json is no longer read`. That comes from
// the outer launcher, not from the 10.6.4 that `packageManager` selects and that
// actually runs, and CI never prints it at all because the workflow installs
// 10.6.4 directly. Do not read it as evidence that the field is inert.)
//
// An advisory belongs here only when **no released version fixes it**, and that
// is enforced rather than promised: a waiver applies only while the report still
// carries npm's no-fix sentinel for it. The day upstream publishes a fix, the
// advisory names its patched line, the waiver stops applying, and the gate goes
// red until someone takes the new version. Anything that already has a patched
// line goes in `pnpm.overrides` instead.
//
// Every waiver this list applied is named in the passing message, so a green run
// states what it let through instead of hiding it.
