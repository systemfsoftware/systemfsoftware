## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Array types are spelled one way. `Array<T>` and `ReadonlyArray<T>` in emitted
  declarations become `T[]` and `readonly T[]`, which the type checker cannot tell
  apart: no exported type changes, only how it is written.

- New version is published through npm trusted publishing, so it carries a provenance attestation you can verify.
