## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- The packages are renamed. `plugin-api` is now `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js`, the
  language every plugin is written against. `mutation-run` is split: the run
  itself is `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-engine`
  (host-neutral, no Node on its manifest) and the Node process entries are
  `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-cli`, which owns the worker files and the runtime
  gate. `mutation-report` is now `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-html-reporter`.
  `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-platform-node` is never published — do not install
  it. Install the new names and change your imports.

  Options types moved. `StrykerOptions`, `PartialStrykerOptions` and `LogLevel` are
  imported from the `Schema` export; `Mutant`, `MutantStatus`, `Position` and
  `Location` from the `Mutant` export. Point a config's `extends` at the language
  package's `Schema` export.

  `MutantStatus` accepts one spelling per outcome: `Killed`, `Survived`,
  `NoCoverage`, `Timeout`, `CompileError`, `RuntimeError`, `Ignored` and `Pending`.
  The lowercase and abbreviated forms — `killed`, `timedOut`, `noCoverage` and the
  rest — are gone. A comparison against a removed spelling never matched the value
  the reporter actually produced, so check any status comparison you wrote.

  Statuses, plugin kinds, exit classes and AST formats are string literal unions
  rather than enums, so read them as their string values. Member access such as
  `ExitClass.VerdictFail` no longer resolves.

  A plugin no longer receives a logger, and the logger port is gone. Plugins log
  through Effect, and the host decides where that output goes.

  The bundled base preset is gone. A config inherits from the language package's
  `Schema` export and states the thresholds, reporters and plugins it wants; you no
  longer silently inherit a package manager, a plugin list or a break threshold.

### Patch Changes

- Peer Effect requirement advances to 4.0.0-rc.112. No API changes.

- The shared helpers package is gone. Nothing installs it any more, and the
  handful of helpers worth sharing now live in the plugin contract next to the
  types they serve:

  - `strykerReportBugUrl`, `normalizeFileName`, `propertyPath`, `errorToString`
    and `isErrnoException` from `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js/core`
  - `noopLogger` from `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js/logging`
  - `testFilesProvided` from `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js/test-runner`

  If you imported any of those, change the specifier. Everything else it exported
  had no consumer and is removed: use `Predicate.isNotNullish` from Effect in place
  of `notEmpty`, and `RegExp.escape` in place of `escapeRegExp`.

- These packages no longer install dependencies they never imported, so installing them pulls less into your tree.

  `tslib` is gone from all six. The mutation runner additionally stops installing `lodash.groupby`, `semver` and `source-map`, and the command line interface stops installing `@effect/platform-node-shared`. Nothing exported changes.

- Published packages no longer carry build artifacts left over from earlier builds. One package was shipping about a megabyte of bundled test-runner internals this way.

- Updated dependencies:
  - @systemfsoftware/stryker-js@2.0.0
