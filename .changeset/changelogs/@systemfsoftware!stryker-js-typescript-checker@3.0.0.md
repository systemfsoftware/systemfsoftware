## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- Three packages are renamed. `plugin-api` is now `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js`, the
  language every plugin is written against. `mutation-run` is now
  `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-platform-node`, the Node host that runs a mutation
  test. `mutation-report` is now `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-html-reporter`.
  Install the new names and change your imports.

  Options types moved. `StrykerOptions`, `PartialStrykerOptions` and `LogLevel` are
  imported from the `Schema` export; `Mutant`, `MutantStatus`, `Position` and
  `Location` from the `Mutant` export. Point a config's `extends` at the language
  package's `Schema` export.

  `MutantStatus` accepts one spelling per outcome: `Killed`, `Survived`,
  `NoCoverage`, `Timeout`, `CompileError`, `RuntimeError`, `Ignored` and `Pending`.
  The lowercase and abbreviated forms — `killed`, `timedOut`, `noCoverage` and the
  rest — are gone. A comparison against a removed spelling never matched the value
  the reporter actually produced, so check any status comparison you wrote.

  Statuses, plugin kinds, exit classes and AST formats are string literal unions
  rather than enums, so read them as their string values. Member access such as
  `ExitClass.VerdictFail` no longer resolves.

  A plugin no longer receives a logger, and the logger port is gone. Plugins log
  through Effect, and the host decides where that output goes.

  The bundled base preset is gone. A config inherits from the language package's
  `Schema` export and states the thresholds, reporters and plugins it wants; you no
  longer silently inherit a package manager, a plugin list or a break threshold.

### Patch Changes

- A type error inside an installed dependency's declaration files no longer fails the run.

  The checker exists to decide whether your source still compiles once a mutant is
  applied. It was also reporting errors from `.d.ts` files inside installed packages —
  most often a package whose optional peer dependency is not installed. No mutant
  causes those, every mutant reports the same ones, and the checker cannot act on
  them, so their only effect was to end the run before a single mutant was tested.

  Library declaration files are now skipped, alongside the code-quality options the
  checker already relaxes while mutating.

- An oversized message between the runner and a worker now fails the run with a
  reason instead of exhausting memory. Each side of the connection reads frames
  up to 16 MiB, which leaves headroom over the largest legitimate payload — a dry
  run carrying per-test coverage — and a frame past the limit fails the calls
  waiting on it rather than growing until the process dies.
