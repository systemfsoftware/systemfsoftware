## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- effect is now a required peer dependency. Install it alongside these packages. They previously bundled their own copy, which meant two Effect instances in one process and services that could not find each other across the boundary.

### Minor Changes

- The Vitest runner accepts `setupFilePath`, naming the setup file it copies into
  the sandbox. It defaults to the file shipped beside the runner's own module,
  which is the right answer for an installed package; supply it only when you are
  running the runner from sources rather than from an install.

### Patch Changes

- The shared helpers package is gone. Nothing installs it any more, and the
  handful of helpers worth sharing now live in the plugin contract next to the
  types they serve:

  - `strykerReportBugUrl`, `normalizeFileName`, `propertyPath`, `errorToString`
    and `isErrnoException` from `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-plugin-api/core`
  - `noopLogger` from `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-plugin-api/logging`
  - `testFilesProvided` from `@systemfsoftware/stryker-js-plugin-api/test-runner`

  If you imported any of those, change the specifier. Everything else it exported
  had no consumer and is removed: use `Predicate.isNotNullish` from Effect in place
  of `notEmpty`, and `RegExp.escape` in place of `escapeRegExp`.

- These packages no longer install dependencies they never imported, so installing them pulls less into your tree.

  `tslib` is gone from all six. The mutation runner additionally stops installing `lodash.groupby`, `semver` and `source-map`, and the command line interface stops installing `@effect/platform-node-shared`. Nothing exported changes.

- Published packages no longer carry build artifacts left over from earlier builds. One package was shipping about a megabyte of bundled test-runner internals this way.

- Updated dependencies:
