If this test is failing for you, it means that you have changed the list of resolutions

scripts/ecosystem-ci/existing-resolutions.ts.

The purpose of this test is to ensure that any changes to the resolutions in package.json
are reflected in the EXISTING_RESOLUTIONS set, which is used by the ecosystem-ci before-test
script to copy the resolutions into the sandbox package.json files.
