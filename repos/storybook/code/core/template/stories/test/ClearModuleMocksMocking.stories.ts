/**
 * The purpose of this story is to verify that the `clearAllMocks` function properly clears mocks
 * created with the `spy: true` option in `sb.mock()`. This is necessary because those mocks are
 * created with a different instance of `@vitest/spy` than the one bundled with storybook/test. This
 * means they won't be cleared by the `clearMocks` option of Vitest, and we need to use
 * `clearAllMocks` to clear them manually. See issue:
 * https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/34075
