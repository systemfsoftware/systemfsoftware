/**
 * React hook to get a stable reference to a service command.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget: the returned async function invokes the command and returns a Promise.
 * Callers manage their own loading/error state. This keeps the hook minimal and composable
 * with any state management approach (local `useState`, `useReducer`, TanStack Query, etc.).
 *
 * The reference is stable as long as `service` and `commandName` do not change, so it is
 * safe to pass to child components or include in effect dependency arrays.
