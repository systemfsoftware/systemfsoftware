/**
 * Shared sync primitives for the open-service multi-master protocol.
 *
 * Every runtime — server (Node), manager (top window), preview (iframe) — runs a full
 * `ServiceRuntime` and reconciles incoming state with the same two rules — last-write-wins ordering
 * and structural merge — so this module is the single source of truth for all of them. The
 * transport that moves snapshots on and off the channel lives in `service-transport.ts`, which every
 * `registerService` entrypoint drives through these primitives (see `service-transport-leaf.test.ts`
 * and `service-registration-sync.test.ts`).
 *
 * ## 1. `isNewer` — last-write-wins ordering
 *
 * Each synced snapshot carries a `(version, clientId)` stamp. `version` is a logical clock for the
 * state lineage: a runtime bumps it on every local command and adopts the incoming value when it
 * accepts a peer's snapshot. Equal versions mean concurrent writes; the lexicographically greater
 * `clientId` wins so every runtime independently converges on the same snapshot regardless of the
 * order events arrive in.
 *
 * Crucially, an *equal* stamp is **not** newer. That single fact is what makes the protocol
 * echo-safe and relay-safe: a snapshot a runtime already holds (its own broadcast bouncing back,
 * or a hub re-emitting an already-applied patch) fails `isNewer` and is dropped instead of
 * re-applied and re-broadcast, so update storms terminate.
 *
 * The stamp lives in the channel envelope, never inside the user state object. Service authors and
 * consumers never declare it, read it, or subscribe to it — whole-state-per-service LWW is a
 * documented semantic of the protocol, not a field anyone has to think about.
 *
 * ## 2. `applyStatePatch` — structural merge
 *
 * Applies incoming state onto the live state object in place so that deep-signal subscriptions only
 * re-fire for the fields that actually changed. Full peer snapshots delete keys absent from the
 * source so deletions propagate; partial static snapshots preserve missing keys. Arrays are replaced
 * wholesale, primitives are assigned only when changed, and the dangerous
 * `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys are skipped on both read and delete so hostile payloads
 * cannot pollute the prototype chain.

 *
 * Open-service runtimes expose their state through deep-signal proxies. Replacing the whole state
 * object for every incoming snapshot would invalidate all subscriptions, even when only one nested
 * field changed. This helper instead walks both objects and mutates `target` only where values differ:
 *
 * - Recurses into plain objects so nested deep-signal subscriptions stay attached.
 * - Replaces arrays wholesale, matching the sync contract that arrays are values rather than maps.
 * - Assigns primitives only when changed to avoid spurious signal invalidation.
 * - Skips `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` on both delete and assign paths so untrusted
 *   channel payloads and static files cannot pollute prototypes.
 *
 * The `preserveMissingKeys` mode selects the source contract:
 *
 * - `false` means `source` is a full peer snapshot. Keys missing from `source` are deleted from
 *   `target`, allowing deletions to propagate through cross-peer sync.
 * - `true` means `source` is a partial static snapshot. Keys missing from `source` are left alone so
 *   snapshots for one static query input do not erase state populated by other inputs.
