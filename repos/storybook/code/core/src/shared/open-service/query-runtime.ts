 * Triggers a `load` if one is not already in flight for the same key, or returns the existing

 * Returns the in-flight promise (whether newly created or reused). The body runs through
 * {@link runLoadBody} and its promise is registered into {@link inFlightLoads} **before** that
 * body starts; see the "register before run" comment below for why.
 *
 * ### Ancestor chain
 *
 * The parent caller passes its own ancestor chain (the load keys it is currently nested
 * inside). This function extends that chain with the dependency's own key before kicking off the
 * body, so any transitive read of an ancestor — e.g. `a.load` calls `b.load` which calls `a.load`
 * again — short-circuits via cycle detection in {@link createDefaultQuery} and
 * {@link buildLoadWrappedQueries}, rather than deadlocking on its own ancestor's promise.
 *
 * ### Cycle example
 *
 * Service exposes queries `a` and `b`; `a.load` reads `b`, `b.load` reads `a`.
 *
 * 1. `a.loaded()` → `triggerLoad(a, parentChain={})` → body runs with chain `{a}`.
 * 2. `a.load` body calls `ctx.self.queries.b.get(...)` → wrapper calls
 *    `triggerLoad(b, parentChain={a})` → body runs with chain `{a, b}`.
 * 3. `b.load` body calls `ctx.self.queries.a.get(...)` → wrapper calls
 *    `triggerLoad(a, parentChain={a, b})`. `a` is already in flight, so the existing promise is
 *    reused. But the wrapper sees `aKey ∈ ancestorChain` and **skips** adding it to b's local
 *    collector — `b` does not wait on `a`'s promise.
 * 4. Both load bodies progress past their sync reads, await their commands, settle.

 * but it also **registers the dependency's load promise into the load-local collector** so
 * `runLoadBody`'s drain can await it before returning. The wrappers therefore turn an ordinary
 * sync read of a dependency into "fire load + remember it for the outer drain to wait on."
 *
 * ### Why one map per load invocation?
 *
 * Two separate `load` calls (different keys, possibly different services) have different
 * `ancestorChain` sets and different `collector` instances. Each wrapped function closes over
 * those values, so the maps cannot be reused — they are recreated cheaply per invocation. Inside
 * a single load body, all nested handler reads share **this same** wrapped map (the closure
 * captures `wrappedQueries` from this scope), so transitive dependency reads continue to register
 * against the same collector.
 *
 * ### Cycle detection
 *
 * If the dependency's load key is already on this load's ancestor chain, we still call
 * `triggerLoad` (it returns the in-flight promise) but we **skip** adding it to the collector.
 * Adding it would deadlock: the outer load's drain would wait on its own ancestor's promise,
 * which is itself waiting on this load. See {@link triggerLoad}'s walkthrough for a concrete
 * `a → b → a` example.
 *
 * ### `.loaded()` and `.subscribe` on the wrapped queries
 *
 * `.loaded()` on a wrapped query forwards the **current** ancestor chain so a load body author
 * can write `await ctx.self.queries.foo.loaded(input)` and trust that the resulting drain
 * inherits the right cycle-protection set. `.subscribe` is passed through unchanged because
 * subscriptions are never part of a load drain — they have their own lifecycle.

 *
 * ### Algorithm
 *
 * 1. **Setup** — validate input, build the session (`ancestorChain` extended with this load key,
 *    an empty `collector`, an empty `settledKeys`). The ancestor chain inherits from
 *    `parentAncestorChain` when this is called from inside a wrapped query (so the inner
 *    `.loaded()` shares cycle protection with the outer load body).
 *
 * 2. **Fire own load** — if this query has a `load` hook, push its in-flight promise into
 *    `session.collector`. Skip if the key is already on the parent's ancestor chain (we are
 *    inside that load already; we cannot deadlock on ourselves).
 *
 * 3. **Drain + discover loop**, up to {@link MAX_DRAIN_ITERATIONS} times:
 *    - Inner loop: while `session.collector` has entries, snapshot them, clear, await with
 *      `Promise.allSettled`, mark their keys in `session.settledKeys`, surface rejections.
 *    - Run the handler synchronously under `activeHandlerLoadSession = session` (a discovery
 *      pass). Sync reads of dependencies inside the handler go through {@link createDefaultQuery}
 *      and register any non-settled, non-ancestor load into `session.collector`.
 *    - If the handler threw, swallow (state might still be partial; a later iteration may fix it).
 *    - If the handler added nothing to the collector, we have converged — exit the loop.
 *
 * 4. **Return** — run the handler one final time under the same session (so dependency reads
 *    respect `settledKeys` and do not refire loads) and return the validated output. This is the
 *    value the caller sees. If state is still incomplete at this point the handler may throw, and
 *    that throw propagates.
 *
 * ### Worked example: `bar.loaded(input)` where `bar.handler` reads `foo`
 *
 * Assume `bar` has no `load` of its own; `foo` does.
 *
 * - **Setup**: session = `{ ancestorChain: {barKey}, collector: ∅, settledKeys: ∅ }`. No own load
 *   to fire (`bar.load` is undefined).
 * - **Iteration 1**:
 *   - Inner drain: collector is empty, skip.
 *   - Discovery pass: handler runs, reads `ctx.self.queries.foo.get(...)`. The default `foo` query
 *     sees `activeHandlerLoadSession === session`, sees that `fooKey` is neither in
 *     `ancestorChain` nor in `settledKeys`, and fires + registers foo's load into
 *     `session.collector`. The handler returns (possibly with stale state).
 *   - `hasMoreWork = true` (collector now has one entry).
 * - **Iteration 2**:
 *   - Inner drain: `await Promise.allSettled([fooPromise])`, mark `fooKey` settled, surface any
 *     rejection.
 *   - Discovery pass: handler runs again. The default `foo` query is now in `settledKeys`, so
 *     it fires nothing and the collector stays empty.
 *   - `hasMoreWork = false`; exit.
 * - **Final**: run handler once more (state is now populated by foo's load), validate, return.
 *
 * The same machinery handles deeper chains — every settled load may have populated state that
 * causes the handler to read **more** queries on the next iteration. The loop keeps draining
 * until the read set stabilizes.

/**
 * Subscribes to a query by running its handler inside a deep-signal-aware `computed()` and
 * notifying through an `effect()`. The callback receives a {@link QueryState} combining the current
 * `data` (the synchronous handler result, or the selected slice) with the per-subscription `load`
 * lifecycle (`status` / `loadStatus` / `error`).
 *
 * The first emission is **synchronous**: `subscribe()` invokes the callback once with the current
 * {@link QueryState} before it returns the unsubscribe handle. The runtime kicks `load` off in the
 * background but does not wait for it — subscribers see the current state immediately (a load-backed
 * query already reads `loading`, since the reactive-load effect runs synchronously here) and
 * follow-up emissions as the load settles (or re-fires) and tracked state changes.
 *
 * Three layers keep emissions precise:
 *
 * 1. **Fine-grained reads** — the handler (and the optional `selector`) read through the deep-signal
 *    proxy, so the computed only re-runs when the exact fields it touched change. A write to an
 *    unrelated key or field never re-runs the handler.
 * 2. **Lifecycle signal** — a separate per-subscription signal carries `status`/`loadStatus`/`error`,
 *    updated by the reactive-load effect. The emit effect reads both it and the data computed, so a
 *    status change (e.g. a background re-load) fires the callback even when the selected slice is
 *    unchanged.
 * 3. **Object dedup** — the whole emitted `QueryState` is compared with the previously emitted one via
 *    `isEqual`; a re-run that produces a deeply-equal state (e.g. a load rewriting an equal payload
 *    with no status change) does not fire the callback.
 *
 * Error sources all surface as `status: 'error'` (keeping the last successful `data`): input
 * validation failure, a synchronous handler / output-validation throw, and a `load` rejection.
