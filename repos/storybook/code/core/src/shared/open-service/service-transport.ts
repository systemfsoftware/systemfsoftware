/**
 * Shared channel-transport helpers for the open-service multi-master protocol.
 *
 * Every runtime that participates in cross-peer sync — the manager (top window), a preview iframe,
 * and the dev server (Node) — does the same two things with its channel: it broadcasts the state its
 * own commands author, and it listens for peers' snapshots so it can reconcile. This module owns both
 * halves so leaf registration (`service-registry.ts`, `relay: false`) and hub registration
 * (`server.ts`, `relay: true`) cannot drift apart in how they wrap commands, gate echoes, or relay
 * adopted state.
 *
 * - {@link connectServiceToChannel} is the single entry point `registerService` uses. It wires all
 *   three halves below against one channel, installs the channel-routed command map on the runtime
 *   (so load bodies can invoke peer-implemented commands), and returns the command map callers
 *   expose plus a combined teardown.
 * - {@link wrapCommandsForBroadcast} wraps a runtime's commands so each local call, after it resolves,
 *   advances the last-write-wins stamp and broadcasts the full post-mutation snapshot.
 * - {@link connectRuntimeToChannel} attaches the sync-start initialization and patch listeners, emits
 *   the bootstrap sync-start, and returns a teardown. A `relay` hub re-broadcasts every snapshot it
 *   adopts so peers on its *other* transports converge; leaves keep `relay: false`.
 * - {@link connectCommandTransport} bridges the gap where a command is only implemented in *some*
 *   runtimes (e.g. a handler supplied at server registration). A runtime without a local handler
 *   requests remote execution; a runtime that has one listens for those requests, runs the command,
 *   and replies. See its docs for the request/ack/result/error protocol.
 *
 * The merge and ordering rules themselves live in `service-sync.ts`; this module only moves snapshots
 * on and off the channel.

/**
 * Wires the remote-command-execution protocol for one service runtime, returning the command map
 * callers should use plus a teardown.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A command handler can be supplied at registration in only *some* runtimes — the canonical case is
 * a server-only handler that needs Node APIs or server context. Runtimes without a local handler
 * still expose the command (so `useServiceCommand`, tests, and other services can call it), but they
 * cannot run it themselves; they must ask a peer that can.
 *
 * ## Protocol
 *
 * - **Requester** (no local handler): the returned command emits `services:command-invoke` with a
 *   unique `callId` and returns a promise. The promise resolves with the first
 *   `services:command-result` for that `callId`, or rejects with the (deserialized) error from the
 *   first `services:command-error`.
 * - **Responder** (has a local handler): on a matching `services:command-invoke` it emits
 *   `services:command-ack` immediately, runs the command locally (which also broadcasts the
 *   post-mutation state via the broadcast wrappers, so peers converge as usual), then emits
 *   `services:command-result` or `services:command-error`.
 *
 * Both roles coexist on one runtime: it responds for the commands it implements and requests the
 * ones it does not. A runtime never requests a command it implements (it runs that locally), so it
 * never answers its own invoke echo.
 *
 * ## Multiple implementers
 *
 * If several peers implement the same command they will each run it and reply. The requester keeps
 * only the first reply per `callId` and ignores the rest. Running a command in more than one runtime
 * is therefore possible by construction; it is constrained by usage conventions and documentation
 * rather than enforced here.
 *
 * ## Topology
 *
 * Replies travel back over the same channel the invoke went out on. A request reaches every peer on
 * the requester's transports; the manager is connected to both the dev server and the preview, so it
 * can invoke a command implemented in either. Command events are *not* relayed across a hub's other
 * transports, so a preview cannot directly invoke a server-only command (and vice versa) — route such
 * calls through the manager or implement the command on a directly-connected peer.
