/**
 * The review payload an agent pushes via the `display-review` MCP tool.

 * Flow:
 *   MCP `display-review` tool → emit PUSH_REVIEW on the Storybook channel
 *   → core-server stamps `createdAt` and caches it
 *   → emits DISPLAY_REVIEW to all open tabs (or replays on REQUEST_REVIEW).
 *
 * This mirrors the canonical valibot schema in `@storybook/addon-mcp` →
 * `tools/display-review.ts`. The manager only renders the data — it does
 * not validate — so it needs the type, not the validator. Keep `title` /
 * `description` / `collections` in sync with that schema.
