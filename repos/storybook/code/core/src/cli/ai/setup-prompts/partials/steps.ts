    b. **Exactly one \`CssCheck\` story** added to one of those files (spec below). This step is not complete without it.

    **Substep a — pick targets and write the files.** Pick ~10 meaningful targets from the real codebase (low-level reusable → page components). Skip subcomponents, hooks, contexts, helpers, and \`App\` itself when real page components exist.

    Each story file: ~3 exports for typical components, up to ~10 when warranted by real usage. Copy JSX patterns from real pages/routes/tests.

    **Tag every new story file with \`['ai-generated', 'needs-work']\` from the start.** You will remove \`'needs-work'\` only after vitest confirms the file passes. This way, anything not yet verified — including stories you ran out of time to fix — stays correctly marked.

    ${getStoryExample(projectInfo)}

    Story rules:

    - Start every meta with \`tags: ['ai-generated', 'needs-work']\`.
    - Show all imports explicitly.
    - Don't add a custom \`title\`.
    - Don't build large story-specific harnesses — fix preview instead.
    - Don't create new app components.

    **Substep b — add the single \`CssCheck\` story.** Before you finish this step, pick **one** visually distinctive component from the files you just wrote and add a \`CssCheck\` export to that file. Exactly **one** \`CssCheck\` across the whole project — not one per file. This step is not complete until the story exists.

    Why it's mandatory: \`toBeVisible\` passes on an unstyled component. A concrete \`getComputedStyle\` value is the only proof that the shared preview actually loaded the app's CSS — without it, you have no idea whether your stories are rendering correctly.

    How: read a real styling value from the component's source (e.g. a hex color in styled-components, a Tailwind class like \`bg-blue-600\`, a CSS variable from the theme), and assert the resolved \`getComputedStyle\` value:

    \`\`\`${tsx}

    title: `Add \`play\` functions only where they prove something non-trivial`,
    body: dedent`
    **Do not put a \`play\` on every story.** A \`play\` is worth writing only when it asserts something the rendered output alone doesn't already prove. Prefer one good \`play\` per file over five redundant ones.

    Write a \`play\` when it can verify:

    - an **interaction** (form fill + submit, click → menu opens, tab change reveals panel)
    - **async data** actually arrived from MSW (waiting for mocked content to replace a spinner)
    - a **portal** rendered into the right root (query via \`canvasElement.ownerDocument\`)
    - a **CSS-driven state** that matters semantically (e.g. theme color, disabled styling, layout that confirms the global stylesheet loaded)
    - **accessibility** that the component is responsible for (correct role/label exposure)

    **Skip \`play\` entirely** when a story is just a static variant of the same component (different \`args\`, no new behavior). Repeating \`getByRole(...).toBeVisible()\` across \`Clear\`, \`Large\`, \`WithIcon\` etc. is redundant — the render itself already fails the test if the component throws or doesn't mount.

    **Smoke plays must prove something the render alone doesn't.** A play that does only \`await expect(canvas.getByRole('button')).toBeVisible()\` adds nothing — the render already failed if the button didn't mount. Acceptable smoke plays assert one of:

    - an **aria attribute reflecting state** (\`aria-expanded\`, \`aria-disabled\`, \`aria-checked\`, \`aria-current\`)
    - a **prop value rendered as text or attribute** (e.g. \`args.label\` appears in the DOM, \`href\` matches \`args.to\`)
    - **async content arriving** (\`findBy*\`, \`waitFor\` — proves the loader/MSW handler actually resolved)
    - a **portal mounting in the right root** (queried via \`canvasElement.ownerDocument.body\`)

    If none of those apply, skip the \`play\` and rely on the render itself.

    Concretely, in a \`Button.stories.${tsx}\` with \`Primary\`, \`Clear\`, \`Large\`, \`WithIcon\`:

    - \`Primary\` — keep one smoke \`play\` (one is enough for the file).
    - \`Clear\`, \`Large\`, \`WithIcon\` — **no \`play\`**. They're variant-only stories.

    (The single \`CssCheck\` story for the whole project was added in Step 5 — don't add another one here.)

    Imports & play context — get this right or vitest will fail in subtle ways:

    - \`expect\` and \`waitFor\` come from \`'storybook/test'\` — import those.
    - \`canvas\`, \`userEvent\`, and \`canvasElement\` come from the **play arguments**: \`async ({ canvas, userEvent, canvasElement }) => { ... }\`. **Do not** \`import { userEvent } from 'storybook/test'\` and **do not** write \`const canvas = within(canvasElement)\` — both are already provided.
    - For **portal queries only**, query via \`canvasElement.ownerDocument.body\`. You may import \`within\` from \`'storybook/test'\` for that case (e.g. \`within(canvasElement.ownerDocument.body).findByTestId(...)\`). Don't use \`within\` for anything else.
