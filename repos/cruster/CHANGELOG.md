## 0.0.27 (2026-04-29)

### Fixes

#### refactor: rely on sqlx migration tracking

Removes the custom migration tracking implementation, uses sqlx's migrator directly for framework migrations, and fixes release PR creation to target the correct GitHub repository.

#### breaking: upgrade sqlx and move single runner construction to a builder

Upgrades `sqlx` to `0.9.0-alpha.1`, adds configurable migration tracking tables through the storage and single-runner builders, and removes the old `SingleRunner::new` and `SingleRunner::with_config` constructors.

## 0.0.26 (2026-02-27)

### Fixes

#### fix: run cruster SQL migrations with a dedicated tracking table

Port the migration runner utility to store migration state in `_cruster_migrations` instead of SQLx's default tracking table.

## 0.0.25 (2026-02-19)

### Fixes

#### fix: correct distributed trace span hierarchy for cross-runner messages

Trace context is now propagated through each layer of the send path so that
spans form a proper causal chain instead of appearing as disconnected siblings.

- `route` (was `send` on ShardingImpl) stamps its span ID on the envelope at
  entry, making `handle_message_with_recovery` a child of the local `route`.
- `deliver` (was `send` on GrpcRunnerTransport) overwrites the envelope's trace
  context with its own span ID before serializing for gRPC.
- `receive` (was `send` on GrpcRunnerServer) reads the envelope's trace context
  and links itself as a child of `deliver`.

Resulting trace hierarchy:
- Local:  `send_persisted_with_key > route > handle_message_with_recovery`
- Remote: `send_persisted_with_key > route > deliver > receive > route > handle_message_with_recovery`

## 0.0.24 (2026-02-17)

### Fixes

#### revert: remove unnecessary capture_trace_context refactoring

The PR #36 fix (moving trace context capture before the debug-level
`build_envelope` span) was based on a wrong diagnosis. OTel context
lookup already falls back to the thread-local `opentelemetry::Context`
when the current tracing span has no OTel data, so filtered-out spans
are not a problem.

The actual root cause of disconnected traces is an `opentelemetry`
version mismatch between cruster (0.28) and autopilot-cruster (0.27),
which produces two separate thread-local context stores in the same
binary.

## 0.0.23 (2026-02-17)

### Fixes

#### fix: capture OTel trace context before debug-level span filtering

Move trace context extraction out of `build_envelope` (debug-level span) into
a `capture_trace_context()` call in each public caller (INFO-level span). This
fixes disconnected traces when per-layer `Targets` filters reject debug spans
from the OTel layer — the exact configuration used in autopilot-cruster.

Add regression tests with `InMemorySpanExporter` that verify trace context
injection works even under INFO-only OTel filters.

## 0.0.22 (2026-02-17)

### Fixes

#### feat: propagate OTel trace context across message boundaries

Envelopes now carry the sender's OpenTelemetry trace/span IDs so that the
receiver's `handle_message_with_recovery` span is linked as a child of the
sender's span. This connects previously disconnected traces (e.g.
`scale_deployment` → `handle_message_with_recovery`) into a single
distributed trace in Jaeger or any OTel-compatible collector.

- Inject trace context in `build_envelope` (covers local, gRPC, and persisted paths)
- Extract and set remote parent in `handle_message_with_recovery`
- Remove redundant gRPC-only `inject_trace_context` / `extract_trace_context`
- Add `opentelemetry` and `tracing-opentelemetry` as required dependencies
- Example app conditionally enables OTLP export via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`

## 0.0.21 (2026-02-17)

### Fixes

#### fix: reduce OpenTelemetry span noise by tiering #[instrument] levels

Background loop drivers (shard acquisition, lock refresh, storage poll, runner health,
lease health) had their #[instrument] removed entirely -- these created infinite-lifetime
spans that never exported properly, appearing as "(missing)" parents in trace backends.

Internal mechanics (rebalancing, singleton sync, storage CRUD, workflow engine, entity
reaping, health checks) downgraded from INFO to DEBUG. User-facing operations (entity
client API, message routing, gRPC transport, activity execution, lifecycle events) remain
at INFO.

#### Remove otel.rs init/setup module from the library crate

OpenTelemetry tracing pipeline initialization (`OtelConfig`, `OtelGuard`, `init_tracing`) is the consumer's responsibility. The library should only emit `tracing` spans (via `#[instrument]`), not dictate how they are collected. All `#[instrument]` annotations and trace-context propagation remain intact.

## 0.0.20 (2026-02-16)

### Fixes

#### feat: add OpenTelemetry instrumentation behind `otel` feature flag

Adds optional OpenTelemetry support with an `otel.rs` initialization module and `#[instrument]` spans across all hot paths (message routing, entity lifecycle, database operations, workflow execution, gRPC transport, shard management). Zero overhead when the feature is disabled.

## 0.0.19 (2026-02-16)

### Fixes

#### feat: derive `Clone` on `EntityClient` and generated entity/workflow clients

All clients are now `Clone`. They are lightweight handles (`Arc` + `String`),
so cloning is cheap and `Arc` wrapping is no longer necessary.

#### feat: add `join()` to workflow clients

Workflow clients now support `join(execution_id)` which blocks until the
workflow result is available, unlike `poll()` which returns `Option`
immediately. Backed by a new `await_reply` method on `Sharding` that
uses `register_reply_handler` for real-time push notification.

## 0.0.18 (2026-02-16)

### Fixes

#### fix: single-param activity key closure passes reference and journal check uses WorkflowStorage directly

The activity key closure for the single-param case now receives `&param` (reference) instead of the owned value, consistent with the multi-param case and preventing move errors when the activity body also uses the parameter.

Journal `check_journal` now queries `WorkflowStorage` directly for cached results instead of inserting synthetic messages into `MessageStorage` for dedup. The old approach caused `__journal/*` messages to leak into the delivery loop, producing spurious failures.

## 0.0.17 (2026-02-11)

### Fixes

#### feat: provide `self.entity_id()` in entity and RPC group handlers

Entity and RPC group `#[rpc]` handlers can now access the routed entity ID
via `self.entity_id()` (returns `&str`) and the full address via
`self.entity_address()`. This eliminates the need to pass `entity_id` as a
field in every request struct. Workflow request structs with domain-specific
ID parameters have been renamed for clarity (`owner_id`, `account_id`).

## 0.0.16 (2026-02-10)

### Fixes

- Remove all memory-based fakes (MemoryMessageStorage, MemoryRunnerStorage, MemoryWorkflowStorage, MemoryWorkflowEngine, TestCluster) and replace with PostgreSQL-backed integration tests. Entities are now fully stateless — state management is the application's responsibility via direct database access. Rewrite README to document the new API: stateless entities with `#[rpc]`/`#[rpc(persisted)]`, durable workflows with `self.tx` (ActivityTx), activity groups, RPC groups, singletons, and cron jobs.

## 0.0.15 (2026-02-07)

### Fixes

#### feat: add activity journaling for crash-recovery replay safety

When a `#[workflow]` method calls a `#[activity]`, the activity result is now
cached via `DurableContext`. On crash-recovery replay, the cached result is
returned instead of re-executing the activity body, preventing duplicate
side-effects.

Also unifies stateless and stateful entity codegen into a single path.
Persistence infrastructure (workflow engine, message storage, sharding,
durable builtins, activity journal wrapping) is now always generated
regardless of whether the entity has `#[state]`. State is orthogonal to
persistence — stateless entities get the same journaling and durable
workflow guarantees as stateful ones.

Key changes:
- `DurableContext` extended with journal check/write/serialize logic
- `ActivityScope::buffer_write` used for atomic journal+state commits
- `generate_stateless_entity` removed (~530 lines); unified into `generate_entity`
- All `state_persisted` guards removed from codegen — persistence always enabled
- Stateless entities now use the View pattern with `Deref` to entity struct

## 0.0.14 (2026-02-07)

### Fixes

#### fix: prevent infinite gRPC self-loop in shard routing

When `shard_assignments` marked a shard as owned by the local runner but `owned_shards` had not yet been populated (during the acquire phase window), `send()`, `notify()`, and `interrupt()` would route the message as "remote" via gRPC to the local runner itself. The gRPC handler called back into `sharding.send()`, hitting the same code path, creating an infinite loop that grew memory at ~350MB/s.

Added self-send guards to all three routing methods: when `get_shard_owner_async()` returns the local runner's address, route locally instead of making a gRPC call. Also handles persisted messages correctly in the self-routed path.

Concurrent `acquire_batch`/`refresh_batch` using `FuturesUnordered` with a concurrency limit of 64, reducing 2048-shard acquisition from 30+ seconds to under 5 seconds.

#### fix: resolve stale state in workflows after activity calls

`self.state` in `#[workflow]` and `#[rpc]` methods previously captured a
point-in-time snapshot at method entry via `ArcSwap::load()`. After calling
an activity that mutated state, subsequent reads of `self.state` within the
same workflow would still return pre-activity values.

Introduces `StateRef<S>`, a read-only proxy wrapping `Arc<S>` that implements
`Deref<Target=S>`. The macro-generated activity delegation methods now refresh
the proxy after each activity commits, so `self.state.field` always reflects
the latest committed state. User-facing syntax is unchanged.

## 0.0.13 (2026-02-06)

### Features

helpers for timing and transient HTTP failures.

## 0.0.11 (2026-02-03)

### Fixes

#### Improved shard distribution balance in rendezvous hashing

Fixes imbalanced shard distribution in rendezvous hashing by switching to a higher-quality hash function.

### Problem

The previous implementation used DJB2 hash with XOR combination, which produced poor distribution across nodes. In production with 3 nodes and 2048 shards, this resulted in up to 11% imbalance (731 vs 655 shards per node).

### Solution

- Added `hash64()` function based on xxHash algorithm with excellent avalanche properties
- Changed `compute_runner_score()` to hash the concatenated key directly instead of XOR-ing separate hashes

### Results (3 nodes, 2048 shards)

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Distribution | 731, 662, 655 | 689, 683, 676 |
| Max difference | 76 shards | 13 shards |
| Imbalance | 11.1% | 1.9% |

This achieves ~6x better balance with no performance impact.

## 0.0.10 (2026-02-03)

### Features

#### Configurable shard assignment with rendezvous hashing

Implements configurable shard assignment strategies for better distribution and performance.

### New Features

#### ShardAssignmentStrategy enum

Choose between different shard assignment algorithms:

- **Rendezvous** (default): Near-perfect distribution with O(shards × nodes) complexity
- **RendezvousParallel**: Same as Rendezvous but parallelized with Rayon (8x faster for 100+ nodes)
- **ConsistentHash**: Ring-based consistent hashing with configurable vnodes (requires `consistent-hash` feature)

#### Benchmark Results (2048 shards, 100 nodes)

| Strategy | Time |
|----------|------|
| RendezvousParallel | 1.35 ms |
| Rendezvous | 10.9 ms |
| ConsistentHash | 175 ms |

### Configuration

```rust
use cruster::shard_assigner::ShardAssignmentStrategy;
use cruster::config::ShardingConfig;

let config = ShardingConfig {
    assignment_strategy: ShardAssignmentStrategy::RendezvousParallel,
    // ...
};
```

### Feature Flags

- `parallel`: Enables `RendezvousParallel` strategy (requires `rayon`)
- `consistent-hash`: Enables `ConsistentHash` strategy (requires `hashring`)

## 0.0.9 (2026-02-02)

### Fixes

#### fix: optimize etcd shutdown from O(shards) to O(1) by revoking lease

Previously `release_all()` deleted shard lock keys one-by-one with 2048 sequential etcd transactions, taking ~34 seconds. Now we simply revoke the runner's lease, which atomically deletes all attached keys (runner registration + all shard locks) in a single O(1) operation, reducing shutdown to milliseconds.

## 0.0.8 (2026-02-02)

### Fixes

#### fix: reorder shutdown to release shard locks after background tasks stop

Moves `release_all()` and shard clearing to execute AFTER waiting for background tasks to complete. This prevents concurrent etcd operations from the rebalance/refresh loops while the lengthy shard release is in progress, reducing shutdown time from ~32 seconds to ~17 seconds.

## 0.0.7 (2026-02-02)

### Fixes

#### Fix shutdown not cancelling in-flight network calls

- Network calls in background loops (get_runners, release, acquire_batch, refresh_batch) now race against the cancellation token using `tokio::select!`
- Fixed runner_health_loop singleton to use its own cancellation token from SingletonContext instead of ignoring it
- Added cancellation checks throughout check_runner_health including during concurrent health checks

Previously, even with cancellation checks between operations, a slow or hanging network call could block shutdown for the full timeout duration. The runner health singleton was also ignoring its cancellation context entirely.

## 0.0.6 (2026-02-02)

### Fixes

#### Fix shutdown hanging due to background tasks not respecting cancellation

Background loops (shard_acquisition_loop, lock_refresh_loop, storage_poll_loop) now check the cancellation token at key points during their work, not just at sleep boundaries. This ensures shutdown completes promptly instead of hanging while tasks continue making gRPC calls.

#### Fix cruster-macros version sync in release workflow

Move `cruster-macros` dependency to workspace dependencies and configure knope to automatically bump its version during releases. This ensures the `cruster-macros` version stays in sync with the workspace version when publishing to crates.io.

- Add `cruster-macros` to `[workspace.dependencies]` in root `Cargo.toml`
- Update `crates/cruster/Cargo.toml` to use `cruster-macros = { workspace = true }`
- Configure `knope.toml` to version the `cruster-macros` dependency in workspace

## 0.0.3 (2026-02-02)

#### Add `SingletonContext` to singleton factory functions for graceful shutdown.

Singleton factories now receive a `SingletonContext` which provides opt-in graceful shutdown. By calling `ctx.cancellation()`, the singleton commits to observing the cancellation token and returning when cancelled. The runtime will wait for singletons that opt-in; singletons that don't will be force-cancelled.

**Key behavior:** When a shard is lost (node failure or rebalancing), the runtime now waits for managed singletons to complete gracefully before allowing another node to start a new instance. This ensures the "exactly one singleton" guarantee is maintained during failover.

**Usage:**

```rust
use cruster::singleton::{register_singleton, SingletonContext};

register_singleton(&*sharding, "my-singleton", |ctx: SingletonContext| async move {
    // Opt-in to graceful shutdown
    let cancel = ctx.cancellation();
    
    loop {
        tokio::select! {
            _ = cancel.cancelled() => {
                // Graceful shutdown - clean up resources
                break;
            }
            _ = do_work() => {}
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}).await?;
```

**API:**

- `ctx.cancellation()` - Returns a `CancellationToken` and opts the singleton into graceful shutdown. The runtime will wait for the singleton to return instead of force-cancelling it.
- `ctx.is_cancelled()` - Check if cancellation was requested without opting in to manage it.

**Breaking Change:** Singleton factory closures must now accept a `SingletonContext` parameter. For singletons that don't need graceful shutdown, simply ignore the parameter with `|_ctx|`.

#### Add support for executing arbitrary SQL within activity transactions.

Activities can now execute custom SQL statements that are committed or rolled back together with entity state changes, ensuring atomicity.

**Usage:**

```rust
##[activity]
async fn transfer(&mut self, to: String, amount: i64) -> Result<(), ClusterError> {
    // State mutation (automatically transactional)
    self.state.balance -= amount;
    
    // Execute arbitrary SQL in the same transaction
    if let Some(tx) = ActivityScope::sql_transaction().await {
        tx.execute(
            sqlx::query("INSERT INTO transfers (...) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)")
                .bind(&self.state.entity_id)
                .bind(&to)
                .bind(amount)
        ).await?;
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**API:**

- `ActivityScope::sql_transaction()` - Returns `Option<SqlTransactionHandle>` (requires `sql` feature)
- `SqlTransactionHandle::execute()` - Execute a SQL statement
- `SqlTransactionHandle::fetch_one()` - Fetch exactly one row
- `SqlTransactionHandle::fetch_optional()` - Fetch zero or one row
- `SqlTransactionHandle::fetch_all()` - Fetch all rows

Returns `None` when using non-SQL storage backends (e.g., memory storage for testing).
