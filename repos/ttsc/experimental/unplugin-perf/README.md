# @ttsc/unplugin per-module cost reproduction

This experiment drives the **real** `@ttsc/unplugin` Rollup plugin object over a synthetic project of `N` TypeScript files and measures, per simulated build:

- **plugin runs** — how many times the whole project is re-transformed (native plugin spawns). A correct per-build cache transforms the project **once**.
- **`fs.readFileSync` calls / bytes** — the content work the adapter performs while serving the `N` modules. A correct cache validates only each module's derived inputs.
- **`fs.statSync` calls** — synchronous validation work. Scenario D adds 100 unrelated nested directories and requires generation-scoped membership notification rather than one directory-stat pass per module.
- **fs identity probes:** the `existsSync`/`realpathSync.native` call volume paid by the shared path-identity resolver on the real host platform. Correct watch-input derivation pays it once per distinct graph path per generation, not once per module delivery.

The guarded invariants are **`plugin runs == 1`** and, for the graph scenario, **bounded probes per module** — the harness exits non-zero when either breaks.

- **Scenario A — output keys under the project root.** The cache hits, so the project is transformed once. (`reads` still grow with `N`: validating a cache hit re-hashes the project to detect a sibling-file change — bounded work that the existing invalidation contract requires.)
- **Scenario B — one output key outside the validator's directory walk** (a `node_modules/**` path, exactly what the native host emits for program dependencies). Before the fix the store-time and validate-time hash key sets diverged, the cache _never_ hit, and the whole project was re-transformed once per module (`plugin runs == N`); now the cache hits and `plugin runs == 1`.
- **Scenario C — a graph-bearing envelope (the typia >= 13.1.19 shape).** The sidecar stamps `graph` (every module edges to its next sibling plus `K` external `node_modules` declarations, and one missing resolution candidate) and per-file `dependencies`. Before the #1007 fix every cache-hit delivery re-walked the whole graph: probes per module grew linearly with the edge count (6.7k/12k/22.8k probes per module at E=2.6k/5.1k/10.1k, ~76-95 s for 99 deliveries), the O(modules x edges) syscall storm behind the #970 residual stall on macOS. The gate is 64 probes per module; the fixed code derives once per generation and stays flat regardless of `E`.
- **Scenario D: the same envelope without a build boundary** (the Vite development server's persistent-validation mode). Each module owns one disjoint external input, and the project contains 100 unrelated nested directories. The gates require reads to stay bounded by that file's inputs and synchronous stats not to grow with either the whole-envelope union or project directory count.

The adapter source is bundled on the fly with esbuild (with `ttsc` and `unplugin` kept external), so the production code path runs unmodified — no rebuilt `lib` required.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --dir experimental/unplugin-perf start
```

Requires a built `ttsc` package (`packages/ttsc/lib`) and a Go toolchain on PATH (the synthetic transform plugin is a tiny Go sidecar).
