/**
 * The evidence obligations of the backend, declared once in the test Program.
 *
 * All three claims live here because this is the Program that holds every host.
 * `test/tsconfig.json` compiles the backend source together with the tests, so
 * controllers and test functions are both selected from it, while the package
 * Program sees only `src/` and could never reach the tests.
 *
 * The schema answers to the requirements, every requirement and every model
 * answers to some controller operation, and every published operation answers
 * to a test. Each edge is many to many, so an obligation counts the units it
 * must cover rather than citations per host.
 *
 * Roots are relative to the package directory, which is where every backend
 * command runs from: `check:watch`, `build:sdk`, and `test` are declared in
 * `packages/backend/package.json`, so the package manager makes that directory
 * the working directory for each of them.
 *
 * Each claim names the one file its exclusions may be written in, resolved
 * against that same root, so the carrier is declared rather than conventional
 * and an `@evidenceExclude` written anywhere else is a compile error.
 *
 * The two file rules are declared here rather than on the package for the same
 * reason: this Program includes `../src` alongside the tests, so it already
 * covers every file they should reach. Declaring them on the package would put
 * them in the configuration `nestia all` resolves when it compiles
 * `nestia.config.ts` through a project of its own making, and that file is an
 * anonymous default export `evidence/singular` can never accept.
 *
 * `include` selects this directory, so the Program holds this file too, and
 * `evidence/singular` would reach the anonymous default export below for the
 * same reason it reaches `nestia.config.ts`. Linting the configuration that
 * declares the rules is never the point, so it is ignored here.
