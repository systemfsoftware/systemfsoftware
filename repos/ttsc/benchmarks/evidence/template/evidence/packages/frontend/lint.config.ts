/**
 * The evidence obligations of the frontend package.
 *
 * The three claims form one chain: a hook answers for the operations it calls,
 * a screen answers for the hooks it uses, and a journey answers for the screens
 * it walks. Owning an operation is not delivering it, so a hook wrapping an
 * accessor no screen renders fails at the screen claim rather than passing on
 * hook coverage alone.
 *
 * `lib/<domain>/hooks.ts` is the only place a generated accessor is called, so
 * a hook is the one artifact that can truthfully own an operation. The screen
 * and journey populations stay narrow for the same reason: a primitive, the
 * layout chrome, a composed provider, and the presentation-only ui-review and
 * readme specs serve every requirement at once and therefore none in
 * particular.
 *
 * Every edge is many to many, so each obligation counts the units it must cover
 * rather than citations per host; one hook may cite as many operations as it
 * calls, and demanding one call per hook would dictate layout instead.
 *
 * The operation and hook references refuse exclusions, because an unconsumed
 * operation and an unused hook are missing work rather than decisions. The
 * requirement and screen references accept a decided one, so a screen outside
 * the journeys is a decision someone has to write down and defend.
 *
 * A journey cites each page it traverses as `{@link ThatPage}` resolved through
 * its own type-only import, so a screen no journey walks surfaces at the
 * compiler rather than in review.
 *
 * The screen and journey claims each name the one file their exclusions may be
 * written in, so the carrier is declared rather than conventional and an
 * `@evidenceExclude` on a working screen or journey is a compile error. The
 * hook claim names none, because its only reference refuses exclusions
 * outright.
