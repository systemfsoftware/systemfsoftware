/**
 * The evidence obligations of the API package.
 *
 * The DTO claims are declared here because a TypeScript claim selects only
 * files the owning `tsconfig` already includes, and this package's `tsconfig`
 * is the one that includes `src/structures/`. The schema they cite belongs to
 * the backend package, which is why the Prisma references root there.
 *
 * Both edges are many to many — one requirement may be represented by several
 * DTOs, and one model exposed by several — so each obligation counts the units
 * it must cover rather than citations per host.
 *
 * Both claims name `src/structures/DTO_EVIDENCE_EXCLUDE.ts` as the one file
 * their exclusions may be written in, so the carrier is declared rather than
 * conventional and an `@evidenceExclude` on a DTO itself is a compile error.
