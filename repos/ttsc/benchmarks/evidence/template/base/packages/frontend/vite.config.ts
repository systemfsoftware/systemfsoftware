/**
 * The `contract` mode is the simulated one, and the mode decides it.
 *
 * Vite lets `process.env` win over every `.env*` file, and the eager
 * `loadEnvFile` above promotes a workspace `.env` into `process.env` before Vite
 * reads any of them. A mode expressed as an env file would therefore be
 * overridden by any `.env` a cell wrote for an unrelated reason, silently, and
 * the contract suite would build live while every document called it simulated.
 *
 * The write is unconditional in both directions on purpose. Setting it only for
 * the contract mode would close that lane and leave the live one exactly as
 * defeatable: a `.env` carrying `VITE_API_SIMULATE=true` would still make
 * `pnpm test:e2e` build simulated, which is the failure the split exists to
 * end. `--mode contract` is simulated, every other mode is live, and no file
 * can disagree with either.
