// Publish the evidence benchmark's tracked aggregate to the site's public tree.
//
// The site is a static export, so a component cannot read `benchmarks/` at
// request time; the data has to be a real file under `public/`. Committing a
// second copy there would make two sources for one measurement, and the one the
// page draws would drift from the one the charts are rendered from. This copies
// instead, and the copy is ignored.
//
// The charts need no copying at all. `@ttsc/benchmark-evidence` owns the
// renderer and writes them straight into `public/benchmark/evidence`, so this
// step only rasterizes what is already there. Drawing a second set here would
// be a second thing to keep in agreement with the aggregate.
//
// That directory is generated and ignored, like the graph benchmark's own. The
// aggregate it is drawn from is the tracked artifact, and committing the charts
// beside it would put the same measurement in the repository twice.
