// Playground compiler worker.
//
// Runs inside a Web Worker bundled by rspack (see `rspack.config.js` and
// `build/compiler.cjs`). The worker boots the `playground.wasm` binary the
// website ships under `public/compiler/`, which is a `@ttsc/wasm`-style
// consumer wasm produced from `website/compiler/cmd/playground/main_wasm.go`
// with the banner / paths / strip / lint / typia plugins linked in.
//
// All meaningful logic lives in `@ttsc/playground`; this file just wires the
// website's URL conventions and typia pack into `createWorkerCompiler`.
