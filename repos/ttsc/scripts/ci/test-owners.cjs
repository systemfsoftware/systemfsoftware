// Prove that every committed executable test owner is claimed by exactly one
// CI executor.
//
// The repository used to decide what CI runs from hand-written lists —
// `scripts/test-go.cjs` names the runners, each runner names its Go packages,
// and `.github/workflows/test.yml` names one matrix lane per suite. Nothing
// bound any of them to the suites that exist on disk, so a committed,
// executable, passing suite that no list named simply never ran, with no signal
// of any kind. Issue #622 was closed by lengthening a list; within a day three
// new orphans appeared and an older one had survived the fix. The finite list is
// the cause, so the remedy has to be an invariant that fails on the next
// unclaimed suite rather than four more names.
//
// The invariant here is two-way. Every owner discovered on disk must appear in
// OWNERSHIP, and every OWNERSHIP entry must still exist on disk. Adding a suite
// without claiming it turns this red; deleting a suite without unclaiming it
// turns this red too, so the map cannot rot into a list of names for things that
// are gone.
//
// Deliberate exclusion stays possible and stays visible: an owner may be claimed
// by `EXCLUDED` with a reason, which is an explicit, named, reviewable entry
// rather than the silence that caused this.
