// The wrapper is the repository's Go formatting specification: `pnpm format`
// writes through it and `scripts/ci/format-check.cjs` compares against it, so a
// defect in it is a defect both halves agree on and neither reports. Two such
// defects are pinned here.
//
// The first is data loss. The normalization that turns gofmt's tabs into this
// repository's two spaces used to be a whole-file substitution, which also
// rewrote a tab inside a string literal. `packages/lint` implements Prettier's
// `useTabs` and its fixtures assert tab-indented output, so those tabs are the
// thing under test; every such fixture spells the tab as a `"\t"` escape because
// a literal one did not survive the formatter.
//
// The second is a partial write. `gofmt -w` emits tabs and the normalization is
// what removes them, so a gofmt failure between the two used to abort the script
// under `set -e` and leave every file gofmt had already written tab-indented.
