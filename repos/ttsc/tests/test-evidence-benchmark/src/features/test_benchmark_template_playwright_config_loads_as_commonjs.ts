/**
 * Verifies the delivered Playwright config evaluates where Playwright runs it.
 *
 * Playwright loads its config through a TypeScript require hook, and the
 * frontend package declares no `"type": "module"`, so the file evaluates as
 * CommonJS. The template shipped it resolving `.env` through
 * `import.meta.dirname`, which does not exist there. That is not a wrong path
 * that surfaces as a failing test — it throws while the config is being read,
 * before a single test is discovered, so the end-to-end gate reports nothing
 * rather than reporting that it could not start.
 *
 * The first cohort paid for this three separate ways, and none of them measured
 * the cell. One cell repaired the line itself and passed its gates. One refused
 * to touch frozen configuration, built a substitute runner instead, and failed
 * its overall review for using it. One received an operator's explicit
 * permission to make the same repair, which no other cell was offered. What a
 * cell scored turned on how it reacted to a defect it did not write.
 *
 * The case evaluates the delivered file the way its loader does rather than
 * reading it for a forbidden spelling: a rule against the words `import.meta`
 * would pass the day someone reaches the same undefined value another way, and
 * would fail `vite.config.ts`, which uses that form correctly because Vite
 * hands its config an ESM-capable loader.
 *
 * It also pins the module system the repair depends on. `__dirname` is right
 * only while the package stays CommonJS, so a later `"type": "module"` must
 * arrive as a failure here rather than as a silent return to a dead gate.
