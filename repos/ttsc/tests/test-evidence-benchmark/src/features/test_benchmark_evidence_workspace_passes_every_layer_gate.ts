/**
 * Verifies the delivered Evidence workspace passes every layer gate while its
 * claims are still staged shut.
 *
 * This is the state a cell is handed, and two opposite failures live in it. A
 * scaffold that cannot build makes the arm unmeasurable — every Evidence gate
 * runs through `ttsc`, which evaluates `lint.config.ts` in a Program of its
 * own, so a configuration that type-checks nowhere fails `build:main`,
 * `build:sdk`, `build:test`, and `lint` alike before any evidence work starts.
 * A scaffold that reports evidence obligations while every claim still carries
 * `disabled` would flood a cell's context with errors for tags it was told not
 * to write yet. The staged graph must be installed, loadable, and silent.
 *
 * 1. Materialize the Evidence arm through the runner's own preparation path.
 * 2. Assert the packed plugin archive was injected as a local dependency.
 * 3. Run every layer gate a cell runs and require a zero exit from each.
 * 4. Assert no obligation was reported, and that `build:sdk` really published the
 *    accessor surface later cases derive their expectations from.
