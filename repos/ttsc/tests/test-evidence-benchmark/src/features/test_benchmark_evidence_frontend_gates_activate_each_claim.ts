/**
 * Verifies every staged frontend claim activates in its instructed order, and
 * that the hook obligation enumerates the SDK through the workspace link.
 *
 * The three frontend claims form a chain — a hook answers for the operations it
 * calls, a screen for the hooks it uses, a journey for the screens it walks —
 * so each one references a population the previous layer produces and only the
 * instructed order can observe any of them. The first link is also the one that
 * broke a cohort: it selects the accessor surface out of an installed
 * `package`, and a workspace dependency is a link that pnpm writes as a
 * junction on Windows. A walker that treats that link as a plain entry returns
 * nothing, and a reference that selects nothing reports full coverage of a
 * frontend that calls no API at all.
 *
 * Nothing this case writes carries a citation, so every claim it opens has
 * something to owe. Silence from an enabled claim is the failure.
 *
 * 1. Read the staged claims from the frontend configuration.
 * 2. Order them by the instruction the measured agent receives.
 * 3. For each, write its host layer, delete its marker, and lint the package.
 * 4. Assert the claim reported obligations, and that the claim reaching the
 *    install owed every accessor the SDK publishes.
