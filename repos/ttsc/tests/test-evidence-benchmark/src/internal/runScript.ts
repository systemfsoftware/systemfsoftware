/**
 * Runs one of the workspace's own package scripts and captures what it said.
 *
 * The scripts are the gate. A launched cell never invokes `prisma`, `nestia`,
 * or `ttsc` directly — it runs `pnpm build:prisma`, `pnpm build:sdk`, and `pnpm
 * lint` from a package directory, and the script bodies decide which project,
 * which output path, and which lint configuration each of those reaches.
 * Re-spelling a command here would test a command this repository does not
 * ship.
 *
 * The package manager is invoked through `process.env.npm_execpath` for the
 * same reason `EvidenceBenchmarkWorkspace` does: it is the entry point the
 * launching `pnpm` already resolved, so no shim on PATH has to be assumed.
 *
 * The environment is sanitized through the runner's own module for the same
 * reason. This suite runs under `ttsx`, which preloads its TypeScript hook into
 * every descendant through `NODE_OPTIONS`; a launched cell's scripts never see
 * it, because `EvidenceBenchmarkRunner` strips it before spawning the measured
 * agent. Leaving it here would run each gate in an environment no cell has —
 * and `vite build` fails outright in it, because loading `vite.config.ts` calls
 * a `resolveSync` the preloaded hook chain does not implement.
