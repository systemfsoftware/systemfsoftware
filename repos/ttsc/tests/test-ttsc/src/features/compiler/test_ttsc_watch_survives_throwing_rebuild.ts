/**
 * Verifies `ttsc --watch` survives a rebuild whose config load throws.
 *
 * The debounced rebuild fires from `setTimeout(runOnce, …)`, outside
 * `runTtsc`'s top-level try/catch. A throw there (here: tsconfig mutated to
 * invalid JSON, which makes `readProjectConfig` throw a `SyntaxError` inside
 * `runBuild`) was previously uncaught and crashed the watcher process. This
 * pins the `runOnce` try/finally fix: a throwing rebuild is reported as a
 * failed build and the watcher keeps running, then terminates cleanly on
 * SIGTERM.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a project that builds cleanly, spawn the real `ttsc --watch`, and
 *    wait for the first build pass to complete.
 * 2. Overwrite tsconfig.json with invalid JSON and touch a source file so the
 *    watcher debounces a rebuild whose config load throws.
 * 3. Assert the watcher reports a failed build (did not crash), then SIGTERM it
 *    and assert it exits on signal rather than dying on an uncaught throw.
