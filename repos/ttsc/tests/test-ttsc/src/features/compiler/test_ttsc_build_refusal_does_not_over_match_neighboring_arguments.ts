/**
 * Verifies the `--build` refusal claims only `--build` / `-b`.
 *
 * The launcher resolves a flag by identity — dashes stripped, lower-cased — so
 * a refusal keyed on that identity is one normalization away from swallowing
 * every neighbouring spelling: the dash-less `build` subcommand, an unknown
 * flag that merely starts with the same letters, and the schema's own
 * build-named passthrough flag with its value token. Each of those must keep
 * the behaviour it had before ttsc learned to refuse solution mode.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a single-project fixture that emits into `dist`.
 * 2. Run the bare `build` subcommand, an unknown `--buildish` flag, and
 *    `--incremental --tsBuildInfoFile <path>`.
 * 3. Assert the subcommand and the forwarded pair still build, `--buildish` still
 *    reaches tsgo's unknown-option diagnostic, and none of the three prints
 *    ttsc's solution-mode refusal.
