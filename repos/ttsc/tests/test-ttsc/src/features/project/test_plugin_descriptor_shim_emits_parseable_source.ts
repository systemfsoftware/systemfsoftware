/**
 * Verifies the plugin-descriptor shim is emitted as source that can parse.
 *
 * The shim is built from a list of template literals, so the template consumes
 * its own escapes before anything reaches disk: a `\n` written where `\\n` was
 * meant becomes a real line terminator inside a JavaScript string literal, and
 * the emitted `.mts` stops parsing. Nothing about that failure points at the
 * cause — every descriptor load fails at the build gate, including the ones
 * that would have succeeded — and it has now shipped twice in this repository,
 * on the Go side and here. `@ttsc/lint`'s extractor has carried this guard
 * since the first time; this is its twin.
 *
 * The emitted string is what is inspected, not this repository's text. Reading
 * the source file would check characters no consumer ever executes, and the
 * defect this exists for is invisible there.
 *
 * 1. Take the shim's emitted source.
 * 2. Assert no line leaves a string literal open, and none carries a control
 *    character a string cannot hold.
 * 3. Assert the environment variables the parent supplies survive.
