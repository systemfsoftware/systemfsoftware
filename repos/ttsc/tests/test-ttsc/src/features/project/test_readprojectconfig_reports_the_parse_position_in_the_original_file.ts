/**
 * Verifies the reported parse position points into the file the user edited.
 *
 * The reader strips comments and trailing commas before `JSON.parse`, so a
 * position reported against that intermediate string names the wrong line
 * whenever comments precede the error, and a position that is confidently wrong
 * is worse than none. Comment, trailing-comma, and BOM removal is therefore
 * length-preserving: each removed character becomes a space and each removed
 * newline stays a newline. Here the error sits on line 6 behind three lines of
 * comments; a shrinking strip reports line 3. The boundary rows are the inputs
 * whose failure carries no position at all, which must still be attributed.
 *
 * 1. Write a config whose unterminated object ends on line 6, behind a line
 *    comment and a two-line block comment.
 * 2. Assert the message names the file and reports line 6.
 * 3. Assert an empty file and a comments-only file are attributed too, and that
 *    valid JSONC with comments, a trailing comma, and a BOM still parses.
