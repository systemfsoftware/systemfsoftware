/**
 * Verifies the platform build target matrix pins linux-arm to the ARMv6
 * baseline.
 *
 * Locks `scripts/platform-target.cjs::resolveGoTarget` and its use in
 * `scripts/build-platform-package.cjs`. The linux-arm package bundles the
 * `linux-armv6l` Go SDK, but the executables were cross-compiled with no GOARM,
 * which the toolchain defaults to ARMv7; the SDK and executables then targeted
 * different CPU baselines. The fix forces GOARM=6 and derives the SDK archive
 * suffix from the same record so all three executables and the bundled SDK
 * share one baseline. arm64 and non-ARM targets are the negative twins that
 * must never acquire a GOARM.
 *
 * 1. Resolve the Go target for linux-arm and assert GOOS=linux, GOARCH=arm,
 *    GOARM=6, and archiveTarget=linux-armv6l.
 * 2. Resolve the negative twins (linux-arm64, linux-x64, darwin-arm64, win32-x64)
 *    and assert none carries a GOARM and each keeps its own archive.
 * 3. Read build-platform-package.cjs and assert the shared record injects GOARM
 *    into a single buildGoTarget that builds all three executables.
