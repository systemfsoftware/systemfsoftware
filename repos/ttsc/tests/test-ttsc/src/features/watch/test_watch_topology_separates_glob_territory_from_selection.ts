/**
 * Verifies a declared glob's root is data even inside a resolution directory.
 *
 * A project root is published as a reload directory because the config that
 * selects plugins lives there, so every entry appearing directly in it reads as
 * a selection change. A declared glob's root is the one entry that must not:
 * appearing is exactly what a declared population does, and the data lane
 * already reports it and invalidates the Program when its membership moved.
 * Classifying it as a selection change restarts the sidecar for ordinary data
 * and loses the process the transition was supposed to keep.
 *
 * The exemption stops at glob roots. A declared file sitting directly in the
 * same directory is still a selection surface, because a project rule reads its
 * bytes to decide, and that decision is made once per execution.
 *
 * The same directory's fingerprint moves whenever anything appears directly
 * inside it, data included, so a digest delta on the directory alone cannot
 * tell a new package from a new data directory. Only the event's own name can,
 * which is why the directory-itself rule belongs to the named event and the
 * fingerprint lane keys on the entry that changed.
 *
 * 1. Take a resolution directory holding both a glob root and a declared file.
 * 2. Assert the glob root stays warm and the declared file stays cold.
 * 3. Assert the directory itself and its other entries stay cold when named.
 * 4. Assert the directory's own digest delta alone does not select cold.
 * 5. Assert a data event cancels no other directory's digest evidence.
