/**
 * Verifies an external declaration never anchors above the project.
 *
 * An external input anchors on its declared parent so a tree that does not
 * exist yet is still observed and so siblings share one handle. Rising is only
 * safe while the anchor stays beside the project. An anchor that contains the
 * project outranks the project's own root once the roots are merged, and then
 * every in-project declaration rides a single recursive handle over a shared
 * system directory — the temp root, or the filesystem root. Such a handle
 * delivers nothing in practice, so the declarations that were supposed to be
 * covered go silent while the build keeps succeeding.
 *
 * 1. Anchor a sibling external tree and keep the parent rule.
 * 2. Anchor one whose parent contains the project and require a narrower root.
 * 3. Decline entirely when even the target's own tree contains the project.
 * 4. Assert the project's own root survives the merge beside an external one.
