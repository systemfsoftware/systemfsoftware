/**
 * Verifies a recursive root is reinstalled only where a replacement strands it.
 *
 * Reinstalling costs one watch descriptor per entry beneath the root and opens
 * a window in which nothing is delivered, so it is worth paying only on the
 * backend that needs it: the per-directory implementation Node uses off macOS
 * and Windows keys its handles by path, so a replaced directory keeps its key
 * and its arriving successor is skipped. Both native subtree backends follow
 * the path instead. A skipped rearm and a silent one look identical at the
 * rebuild boundary, so the rule is pinned here rather than inferred.
 *
 * 1. Declare an exact file, a reload directory, and a glob population.
 * 2. Require a rearm where a declaration is anchored, on the path-keyed backend.
 * 3. Require none on the native backends, for a file, or below a glob root or a
 *    reload directory, whose own digest nothing beneath it can reach.
