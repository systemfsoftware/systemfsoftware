/**
 * Verifies watchers register physical paths while reporting declared ones.
 *
 * The two spellings must not be mixed. A watcher backend stores the string it
 * was given and matches delivered events against it after canonicalizing them,
 * so registering an aliased spelling breaks event delivery — on Windows libuv
 * expands each event to its long path and aborts the process when the stored
 * string is no longer its prefix, which any short (8.3) component produces.
 * Classification runs in the opposite domain: every compiler, config, and
 * plugin decision is expressed in the caller's own paths, so a notification
 * that arrived through the physical spelling would stop matching them.
 *
 * 1. Point a directory alias at a real project root.
 * 2. Watch the project through the alias and edit a tracked source file.
 * 3. Assert the change is reported under the alias, not the physical root.
