/**
 * Verifies a directory event is admitted from where it happened.
 *
 * Admission is the only bound on how often a watch session re-reads and
 * re-hashes its declared corpus, and a silent rescan is indistinguishable from
 * a skipped one at the rebuild boundary, so the rule is pinned here. An atomic
 * replacement names the directory that was swapped rather than the declared
 * file whose bytes it changed, and that directory need not contain any
 * declaration — so containment alone drops it. Anything whose parent is off the
 * path to every declaration cannot have re-anchored one, and admitting it would
 * re-fingerprint the corpus once per entry an install creates.
 *
 * 1. Declare one exact file and one glob population inside a project.
 * 2. Admit the sibling directory an atomic replacement leaves behind.
 * 3. Admit the dependency root beside it and reject everything below that root,
 *    which is the pair the rule turns on.
 * 4. Reject an unrelated ordinary file and keep a missing glob root admissible.
