/**
 * Verifies an entry outside the project's `include` takes its module format
 * from that project rather than from a default.
 *
 * "ttsx targets the tsconfig" is the whole contract for an excluded entry, and
 * the module option is the part of it with a consequence the run can show:
 * under the project's `nodenext` the package's missing `"type"` makes this a
 * CommonJS module and Node hands it `__dirname`. A synthesized entry project
 * that dropped the option would derive the kind from `target` instead, emit an
 * ES module, and print `esm` — so the two answers are distinguishable at run
 * time rather than merely asserted.
 *
 * Two options are deliberately not pinned here. `strict` cannot be, because
 * dropping it only makes a program compile that otherwise would not: its
 * inheritance is proved by the twin case, whose entry fails on an error
 * `strict` alone produces. `paths` cannot be either — it is a compile-time
 * mapping tsgo does not rewrite into the emit, so no ttsx entry resolves an
 * alias at run time, inside `include` or outside it.
 *
 * 1. Create a CommonJS-package project with `module: "nodenext"` and `include:
 *    ["src"]`.
 * 2. Run ttsx against a root-level script that reads `__dirname`.
 * 3. Assert it ran and reported `cjs`.
