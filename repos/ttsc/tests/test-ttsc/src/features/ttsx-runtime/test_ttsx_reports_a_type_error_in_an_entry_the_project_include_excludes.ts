/**
 * Verifies an entry outside the project's `include` is still type-checked
 * before it runs.
 *
 * The negative twin of running an excluded entry. The cheap way to make such an
 * entry executable would be to type-strip it and skip the check, which would
 * silently drop ttsx's whole promise — "run a TypeScript file, but type-check
 * first" — for exactly the scripts a project keeps outside `src`. The entry is
 * compiled through a real project instead, so its own diagnostics stop the run,
 * and the message names the entry rather than the internal "emitted entry not
 * found" that used to surface here.
 *
 * The error is one only `strict` produces: `null` is assignable to `number`
 * without it. So this also pins that the synthesized entry project inherits the
 * real tsconfig's options rather than compiling under a default set — if it
 * dropped them, this entry would compile and run.
 *
 * 1. Create a project with `strict`, `include: ["src"]`, and a root-level script
 *    whose only error requires `strict` to exist.
 * 2. Run ttsx against that script.
 * 3. Assert the run fails, reports the entry's own diagnostic, and never executes
 *    the script's side effect.
