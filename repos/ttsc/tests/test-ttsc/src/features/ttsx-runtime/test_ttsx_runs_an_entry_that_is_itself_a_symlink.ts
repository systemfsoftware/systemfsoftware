/**
 * Verifies an entry that is itself a symlink is served by the project's own
 * emit, not by the orphan type-strip lane.
 *
 * Two different questions are asked about an entry, and they have two different
 * answers. _Which project compiles this?_ comes from the path the user named,
 * because discovery walks up from it — resolving the link first would look for
 * a tsconfig in the target's tree. _Where is the output and what does the
 * runtime load?_ comes from the physical path, because Node keys a module by
 * `fs.realpathSync` without `--preserve-symlinks`. tsgo forces nothing — it
 * takes `files` verbatim — which is exactly why it must be handed Node's
 * spelling rather than a different one.
 *
 * Getting either half wrong is silent. One spelling too few and the gate claims
 * an emit the runtime then refuses to serve, so the file falls to the orphan
 * lane and the project's transform plugins, `target`, `paths`, and source map
 * are all dropped from a run that still prints and still exits zero.
 *
 * So printing is not the assertion. The served script's source map is: the
 * entry-project lane inlines one (forced on when the project configures none),
 * and the orphan lane emits with `--ignoreConfig` and no `--sourceMap` at all.
 *
 * 1. Put the real script outside the project and link to it from inside.
 * 2. Run ttsx against the link under V8 coverage.
 * 3. Assert it ran and that the served script carries a source map.
