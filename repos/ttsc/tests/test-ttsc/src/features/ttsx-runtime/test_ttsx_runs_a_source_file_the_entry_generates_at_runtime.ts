/**
 * Verifies ttsx runs a `.ts` source the entry writes into its own project at
 * runtime, after the up-front build already finished.
 *
 * A program can generate sources and import them in the same run — a test
 * corpus that writes thousands of feature files, then loads them. Those files
 * do not exist when `prepareExecution` type-checks and emits the entry project,
 * so the entry build never emits them. When one is later required, no build
 * owns its on-disk output, so the runtime hooks must still compile it on demand
 * (the orphan single-file path) and run it correctly. This pins that path: a
 * file created after the build must load and execute, not fail as missing.
 *
 * The generated file is CommonJS-classified (the project has no `type:
 * "module"`) and written with ECMAScript module syntax, so a plain type-strip
 * would leave its `export` dangling; the lowering must turn it into CommonJS.
 *
 * 1. The entry writes `src/generated/leaf.ts` (an `export const`) at runtime, then
 *    `require`s it.
 * 2. Run ttsx against the entry.
 * 3. Assert the generated module loaded and produced its value.
