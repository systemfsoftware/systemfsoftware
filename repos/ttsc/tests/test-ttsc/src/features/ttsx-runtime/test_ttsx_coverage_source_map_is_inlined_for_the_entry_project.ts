/**
 * Verifies ttsx serves the entry project's emit with an inlined, absolutized
 * source map, so Node's V8 coverage remaps it correctly (issue #353).
 *
 * Ttsx runs tsgo-built JavaScript under the original `.ts` URL. With external
 * maps (a library's default `sourceMap: true`) the served text ended with a
 * relative `//# sourceMappingURL` Node could never resolve, so V8 cached the
 * script with `data: null` and c8 misattributed lines — a never-called function
 * reported 100% covered. The serve path now inlines the sibling map and
 * rewrites its `sources` to the real absolute path, so `data` is present and
 * points at the true source; V8's raw counts (used ran, unused did not) then
 * attribute to the right lines.
 *
 * 1. Build an entry project (`sourceMap: true`) whose `lib.ts` has a called and an
 *    uncalled export behind a tall comment; run it under `NODE_V8_COVERAGE`.
 * 2. Assert the `lib.ts` script's `source-map-cache.data` is non-null and its
 *    `sources[0]` is the real absolute `lib.ts`.
 * 3. Assert V8 recorded `unused` with count 0 and `used` with count >= 1.
