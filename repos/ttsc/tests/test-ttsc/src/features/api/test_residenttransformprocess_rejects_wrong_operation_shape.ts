/**
 * Verifies a well-formed JSON object of the wrong operation shape rejects with
 * an operation-specific protocol error rather than resolving as a valid reply.
 *
 * Framing (a JSON object) is necessary but not sufficient: a transform request
 * must be answered with a boolean `found` (and a string `typescript` when
 * found), an update request with a boolean `updated`. An update-shaped reply to
 * a transform request, or a `found: true` reply that omits `typescript`, is a
 * protocol error the FIFO cannot detect, so the client validates the shape per
 * operation and rejects a mismatch. The negative twins — valid `found: false`
 * and `updated: false` — must still resolve (a separate test).
 *
 * 1. Answer a transform request with `{ updated: true }` and with `{ found: true
 *    }` (no `typescript`); both must reject.
 * 2. Answer an update request with `{ found: true, typescript: "x" }`; it must
 *    reject.
 * 3. Assert each rejection names the offending operation.
