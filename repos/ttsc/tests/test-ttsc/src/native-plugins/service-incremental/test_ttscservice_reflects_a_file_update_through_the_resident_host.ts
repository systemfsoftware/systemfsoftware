/**
 * Verifies TtscService reflects a file update through the resident host.
 *
 * The incremental half of the resident host (samchon/ttsc#255): an editor or
 * watch consumer feeds an unsaved buffer through `updateFile`, and the next
 * `transformFile` must return the edited source, re-run through the linked
 * plugins, without restarting the host. This is what makes the service
 * incremental rather than merely resident.
 *
 * Uses the shared utility-plugins fixture (banner/paths/strip share one linked
 * host). Exercises the real native compiler and a Go linked host, so it runs in
 * CI.
 *
 * 1. Transform `src/main.ts` and confirm the banner ran on the original source.
 * 2. Update `src/main.ts` with new content and confirm the rebuild succeeded.
 * 3. Re-transform and confirm the new content is returned, the plugins re-ran
 *    (banner still present), and the original source is gone.
