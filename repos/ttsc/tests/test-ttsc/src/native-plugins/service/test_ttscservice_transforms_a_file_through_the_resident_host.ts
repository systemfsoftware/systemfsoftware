/**
 * Verifies TtscService transforms files through one resident host.
 *
 * The resident counterpart to `TtscCompiler.transform`: instead of recompiling
 * the project per call, `TtscService` keeps a `serve` host warm and answers
 * per-file requests from it (samchon/ttsc#255). This is the path a Metro worker
 * pool or an editor session reuses, so it must (1) run the linked transform
 * plugins inside the resident host, (2) serve a stable cached result across
 * calls, and (3) report a file outside the program as absent rather than
 * error.
 *
 * Uses the shared utility-plugins fixture (banner/paths/strip share one linked
 * host; lint is a check plugin the resident transform path ignores). Exercises
 * the real native compiler and a Go linked host, so it runs in CI.
 *
 * 1. Copy the fixture project and seed its `@ttsc/*` plugin packages.
 * 2. Transform `src/main.ts` and assert the banner plugin ran in the host.
 * 3. Re-transform the same file and assert an identical (cached) result.
 * 4. Ask for a file outside the program and assert `undefined`.
