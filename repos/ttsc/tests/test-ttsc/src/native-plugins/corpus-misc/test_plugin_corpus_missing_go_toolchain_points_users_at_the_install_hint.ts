/**
 * Verifies plugin corpus: missing Go toolchain points users at the install
 * hint.
 *
 * Source plugins require `go build`, and first-time users often do not have Go
 * in PATH. When neither `go` nor the `TTSC_GO_BINARY` override resolves to a
 * real binary, including a missing named Windows `.cmd` wrapper rejected before
 * selecting `cmd.exe`, ttsc must emit a human-readable message (`Go toolchain
 * was not found`) and name the env variable they can set to fix it.
 *
 * 1. Copy the `go-source-plugin` fixture into a temp directory.
 * 2. Run ttsc with a PATH that contains no Go binary and `TTSC_GO_BINARY` pointing
 *    at a nonexistent path.
 * 3. Assert non-zero exit, `Go toolchain was not found`, and `TTSC_GO_BINARY` in
 *    stderr.
