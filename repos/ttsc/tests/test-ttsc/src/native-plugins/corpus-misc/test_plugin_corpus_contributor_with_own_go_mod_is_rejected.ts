/**
 * Verifies plugin corpus: a contributor that ships its own `go.mod` is rejected
 * before any compilation happens.
 *
 * Locks the supply-chain firewall added with the `contributors` mechanism: a
 * contributor must compile inside the host plugin's module graph so that every
 * transitive Go dependency is resolved through the host's pinned `go.sum`. A
 * contributor with its own `go.mod` would silently pull in arbitrary modules at
 * build time; ttsc must refuse to merge it.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a host plugin whose factory declares one contributor whose source
 *    directory contains a `go.mod` file.
 * 2. Run ttsc and capture its stderr.
 * 3. Assert non-zero exit and a stderr message that names the offending
 *    contributor and points at the `go.mod` path.
