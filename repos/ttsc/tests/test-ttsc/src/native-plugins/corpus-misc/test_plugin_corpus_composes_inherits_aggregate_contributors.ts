/**
 * Verifies plugin corpus: a composed plugin inherits the aggregate's
 * `contributors`.
 *
 * Regression lock for `loadProjectPlugins.ts::composePluginSources` (issue
 * #101). A composed plugin is rerouted to the aggregate's `source`; it must
 * ALSO inherit the aggregate's `contributors`, because `buildSourcePlugin` keys
 * its native-binary cache on `source` + `contributors`. Without the inheritance
 * the aggregate record (with contributors) and the composed record (without)
 * resolve to two divergent binaries, and ttsc aborts with "multiple compiler
 * native backends cannot share one emit pass". The separate guard that rejects
 * a composed plugin declaring its OWN `contributors` is unaffected — "inherits
 * the aggregate's" and "may not declare its own" are not in conflict.
 *
 * 1. Materialize an aggregate plugin that both `composes` a target transform and
 *    declares a `contributors` entry, plus the redirected target whose own
 *    `source` points at a missing directory.
 * 2. Run `ttsc --emit`.
 * 3. Assert a zero exit (the composed and aggregate records share one native host)
 *    and that the target's suffix transform still reached the emitted
 *    JavaScript.
