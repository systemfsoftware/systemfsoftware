/**
 * Verifies an old holder's delayed finalizer cannot release its successor.
 *
 * A first child keeps generation A alive while the parent retires A and lets a
 * second child acquire B. Only after B is visibly current may A run its normal
 * `finally`; A's deterministic tombstone already exists, so its rename fails
 * without touching B.
 *
 * 1. Hold generation A in a child and reclaim it from the parent.
 * 2. Let a second child acquire B, then release A's delayed finalizer.
 * 3. Assert A reports loss, B remains current, and B later releases normally.
