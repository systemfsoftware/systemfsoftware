/**
 * Verifies inspectPluginBuildLock keeps a fresh metadata-less lock active.
 *
 * Negative twin of both the `released` and the abandoned-legacy classifications
 * in `buildSourcePlugin.ts::inspectPluginBuildLock`. A lock directory that
 * exists but has no `owner.json` yet is the normal instant between a holder's
 * `mkdir` and its owner write — treating it as released would race waiters into
 * duplicate acquisition, and treating it as abandoned would steal a healthy
 * holder's lock.
 *
 * 1. Create a lock directory with a current mtime and no `owner.json`.
 * 2. Inspect it.
 * 3. Assert the state is `active` with the legacy-lock owner label.
