/**
 * Verifies waitForPluginBinary times out on a live owner with a finite
 * duration.
 *
 * Pins the wait-budget escape hatch that survives the #421 rework: a lock held
 * by a live process that never publishes must eventually surface as `abandoned`
 * via the timeout, and the timeout reason must print a real measured duration —
 * the release/abandon distinction may never disable the bound, or a wedged
 * holder would hang every waiter forever.
 *
 * 1. Acquire a v2 lock owned by this process so inspection stays `active`.
 * 2. Call the wait loop with a zero timeout budget.
 * 3. Assert it returns `abandoned` with a `timed out after <finite>` reason
 *    containing no `Infinity`/`NaN` token.
