 * (`textDocument/codeAction`, `workspace/executeCommand`), so a session in
 * which nothing upstream came back at all stayed green. That is exactly what
 * #863 caught — and the cause was the client, not the proxy. TypeScript-Go
 * sends `client/registerCapability` from its `initialized` handler and blocks
 * its dispatch loop until the reply lands, so a client that ignores
 * server→client requests receives ttscserver's own publications forever while
 * every forwarded request queues behind a loop that never advances.
 *
 * 1. Handshake as a completion/hover/symbol-capable client and assert
 *    TypeScript-Go's own providers survive ttsc's rewrite of the result.
 * 2. Open the file and wait for the `@ttsc/lint` `no-var` finding, so the ttsc
 *    half is known to be answering before the upstream half is asked anything.
 * 3. Ask hover, documentSymbol, and completion, and assert each comes back with
 *    TypeScript-Go's own answer rather than merely coming back.
 * 4. Assert `client/registerCapability` was answered, the handshake the whole
 *    upstream stream hangs on.
