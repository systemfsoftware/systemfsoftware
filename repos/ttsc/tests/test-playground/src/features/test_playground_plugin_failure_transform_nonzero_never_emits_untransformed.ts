/**
 * A configured typia transform that exits nonzero must fail the build, never
 * silently fall through to compiling the original untransformed source.
 *
 * RA-03 (#664): both `compile` and `bundle` route the plugin envelope through
 * the same nonzero-code boundary the base `api.build` already used. The oracle
 * is the recorded `build` call count — a genuine failure means `api.build` is
 * never reached, so no JavaScript (transformed or not) can be emitted.
 *
 * 1. Transform verb resolves `{ code: 2 }`; both compile and bundle must return
 *    `type: "error"` and leave the build uninvoked (`record.build` empty).
 * 2. Negative twin: the same wiring with a `code: 0` transform whose payload
 *    rewrites the entry must succeed, invoke the build exactly once, and feed
 *    the build the rewritten text (proving the transform result is honored).
