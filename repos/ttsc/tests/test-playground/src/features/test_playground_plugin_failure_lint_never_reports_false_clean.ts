/**
 * A lint plugin that fails to run must stay visible; it can never collapse into
 * an empty (clean) diagnostic list. A lint run that _completed_ — even with a
 * nonzero exit because it found violations — reports its parsed findings
 * unchanged.
 *
 * RA-03 (#664): the pre-fix lint path always parsed stderr and its catch branch
 * returned `{ diagnostics: [] }`, so a crashed or nonzero-with-no-output plugin
 * looked identical to a clean file.
 *
 * 1. Code 2 whose stderr yields no parseable diagnostic → exactly one error
 *    diagnostic (a surfaced failure, not an empty clean result).
 * 2. Rejected plugin call → exactly one error diagnostic.
 * 3. Negative twin: code 2 whose stderr parses into a real finding → that finding
 *    is preserved, not replaced by a generic failure.
 * 4. Boundary: code 0 with empty stderr → genuinely clean empty result.
