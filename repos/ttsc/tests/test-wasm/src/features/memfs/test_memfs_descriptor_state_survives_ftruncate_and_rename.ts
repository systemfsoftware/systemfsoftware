 * Verifies a MemFS descriptor keeps its cursor and flags across `ftruncate` and
 * a rename that moves the file underneath it.
 *
 * `rename` already re-points open descriptors at the moved path and `ftruncate`
 * already resizes through one, but neither ever met a write that consults the
 * cursor. A descriptor left pointing past a shrunken end-of-file must zero-fill
 * the gap on the next sequential write instead of silently relocating it, and a
 * moved descriptor must apply its retained append flag to the node at its new
 * path.
 *
 * 1. Read four bytes, shrink the file to one with `ftruncate`, then write at the
 *    cursor.
 * 2. Rename the file and write again through the same descriptor.
 * 3. Assert the gap was zero-filled, the write followed the rename, and an
 *    `O_APPEND` descriptor still appends after its file moves.
