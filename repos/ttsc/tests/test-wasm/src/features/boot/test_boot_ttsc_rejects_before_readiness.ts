/**
 * Verifies bootTtsc rejects with an actionable error when the Go runtime exits
 * before signaling readiness.
 *
 * This is the core RA-18 defect: `go.run` was started fire-and-forget and only
 * `Ready`/`Failed` were awaited, so a runtime that exited before either signal
 * (an early `host.Expose` panic that never reached the `Failed` bridge) left
 * the public boot Promise pending forever. Racing `go.run` settlement against
 * readiness makes an unsignaled early exit reject with a synthesized cause
 * instead of hanging.
 *
 * 1. Stub a fake runtime whose `go.run` resolves without calling Ready/Failed.
 * 2. Boot it.
 * 3. Assert the boot rejects and the message names the early exit before
 *    readiness.
