/**
 * Verifies that after a boot fails past global installation and a retry
 * succeeds, the returned host is the exact filesystem the Go runtime captured.
 *
 * This is the RA-20 defect: a failed attempt left its `globalThis.fs`
 * installed, so a retry (which only installs `fs` when absent) created a fresh
 * host, saw the stale global, and returned a host the runtime never used —
 * files written through it were invisible to the compiler. Restoring the failed
 * attempt's own globals lets the retry install and return the host its runtime
 * binds.
 *
 * 1. First fetch returns 503 (fail after installing `fs`); second returns 200.
 * 2. The successful runtime records the `globalThis.fs` it captured at start.
 * 3. Assert the returned `host.fs` is that captured fs and a file written through
 *    the returned host is readable via that same fs.
