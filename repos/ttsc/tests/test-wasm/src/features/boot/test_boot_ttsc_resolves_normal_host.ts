/**
 * Verifies bootTtsc resolves when the host signals readiness and its runtime
 * keeps running, with no unhandled rejection.
 *
 * This is the positive baseline the early-exit rejection cases are twinned
 * against: a normal Go host fires `Ready` and then keeps `go.run` pending
 * forever. The boot must resolve on `Ready`, return the exact host it
 * installed, and the never-settling `go.run` branch that lost the readiness
 * race must not surface as an unhandled rejection.
 *
 * 1. Stub a fake runtime that signals ready then returns a never-settling promise.
 * 2. Boot it and let a few event-loop turns pass.
 * 3. Assert the api and host came back and no unhandled rejection fired.
