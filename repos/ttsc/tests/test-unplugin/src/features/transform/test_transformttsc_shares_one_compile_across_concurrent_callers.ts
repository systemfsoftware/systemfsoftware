/**
 * Verifies concurrent transforms of one module still compile the project once
 * (#672).
 *
 * The failed-generation eviction fix must preserve single-flight: two callers
 * racing for the same cache key share the one in-flight generation rather than
 * each spawning a compile. This is the preservation twin of the eviction
 * scenarios.
 *
 * 1. Build the run-log fixture that counts whole-project compiles.
 * 2. Fire two `transformTtsc` calls for the same module concurrently, sharing one
 *    cache.
 * 3. Assert both return transformed output and the fixture compiled exactly once.
