 * calls but routes one suspended transform through another cache's counters or
 * injected failures. Concurrent projects must retain their own context across
 * every async generation boundary.
 *
 * 1. Start transforms for two distinct projects and caches concurrently.
 * 2. Inject post-compile readdir failures only through the first cache.
 * 3. Assert both transforms finish, both counters run, and the first operation
 *    never observes the second project's paths.
