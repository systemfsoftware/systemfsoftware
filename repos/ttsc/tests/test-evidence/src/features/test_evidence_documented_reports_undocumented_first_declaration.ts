/**
 * Verifies the packaged rule fails a build when only a later half of a merged
 * identity carries a block.
 *
 * This is the case that pins "the first declaration that can host a citation is
 * the basis" rather than "a block anywhere will do", and it is the firing twin
 * of the accepting fixture — without it, a rule that had stopped reading
 * placement entirely would look identical. Every fixture puts its block on a
 * declaration other than the one that founds the identity, whether the identity
 * is a merge or a const behind a default export, and every one is reported.
 *
 * 1. Document the later half of an interface merge and of a class merge, and the
 *    default export rather than its const.
 * 2. Enable `evidence/documented` with the default selection.
 * 3. Assert a non-zero exit naming each identity.
