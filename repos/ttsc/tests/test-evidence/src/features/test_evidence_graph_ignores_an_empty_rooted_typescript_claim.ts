/**
 * Verifies a rooted TypeScript claim with no selected Program host is inactive.
 *
 * A TypeScript `root` changes the address space for Program sources; it does
 * not scan the filesystem. When that population contains no selected export,
 * the claim owns no acknowledgement host and its references must not run.
 *
 * 1. Declare a sibling TypeScript root with no admitted Program source.
 * 2. Put an otherwise uncovered Markdown heading behind that empty claim.
 * 3. Assert the real `ttsc check` succeeds without population or coverage noise.
