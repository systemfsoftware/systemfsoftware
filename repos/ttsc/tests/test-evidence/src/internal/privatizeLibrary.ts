/**
 * Replaces a fixture's linked plugin `lib` with a private copy it may damage.
 *
 * `createProject` junctions the workspace build into every fixture so a case
 * always runs the code under test. That is right for every other case and
 * unusable for one that needs to break the toolchain mid-session: a delete
 * through the junction would land on the workspace itself.
 *
 * The link is removed with `unlink`/`rmdir` rather than a recursive remove.
 * Neither call can descend, so the target is unreachable from here by
 * construction rather than by trusting a flag — and if the path is somehow not
 * a link, this refuses to touch it at all.
