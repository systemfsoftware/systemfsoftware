/**
 * Verifies lint contributor protocol: `@ttsc/lint`'s `contributors` field
 * surfaces a third-party rule through the same diagnostic stream as the
 * built-in corpus.
 *
 * Pins the end-to-end path that the contributors design depends on: the JS
 * factory resolves the npm package, ttsc's plugin builder copies the
 * contributor's Go source into the host binary, the `init()` chain registers
 * `demo/no-todo-comment` before `main` runs, and the engine dispatches to it
 * through the same adapter as a built-in rule. A regression in any of those
 * stages would either drop the diagnostic or route it through a separate
 * stream, both of which violate the "single channel through @ttsc/lint"
 * invariant.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a lint fixture with one TODO comment and one FIXME comment in the
 *    source, plus a discovered `lint.config.json` declaring the contributor.
 * 2. Symlink the workspace `@ttsc/lint` and `lint-contributor-demo` packages into
 *    the temp project's `node_modules` so the JS factory's `require.resolve`
 *    reaches them.
 * 3. Run ttsc and assert both violations come out as `demo/no-todo-comment` errors
 *    under the standard `[rule] message` banner, with the rule name unchanged
 *    and the host's exit code non-zero.
