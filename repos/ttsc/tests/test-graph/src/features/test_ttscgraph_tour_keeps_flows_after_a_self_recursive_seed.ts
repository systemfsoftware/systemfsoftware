/**
 * Verifies one self-recursive function cannot silence the flows ranked after
 * it.
 *
 * `runTour` deduplicates flows by comparing where each candidate landed against
 * what it has already told, and `overlaps` reported a match whenever the
 * smaller of the two sets was empty. `told` is a candidate for "smaller", so
 * one empty set entering it made every later candidate a synonym of nothing.
 *
 * A directly self-recursive function produces exactly that set: `runTrace`
 * records a back-edge to the start as a hop without adding a node, because the
 * start travels separately, so the flow had a hop and reached nobody. The tour
 * then published one flow that said it went nowhere and discarded every real
 * flow behind it. Recursion is ordinary — a retry loop, a tree walk, a parser's
 * descent — so this was not an exotic input.
 *
 * The recursive function is named `attempt` on purpose. Dump nodes are sorted
 * by id, so a name that sorts AFTER `handle` puts the empty candidate last,
 * where it poisons nothing and the test passes against the unfixed code.
 * `attempt` sorts first, which is the ordering the defect needs.
 *
 * 1. Tour a project holding a self-recursive function and a real two-hop chain.
 * 2. Assert the real chain is reported.
 * 3. Assert no flow was published with an empty `reached`.
 * 4. Tour the same project without the self-recursive function and assert it
 *    reports the same set of non-empty flows, so the recursion changes nothing
 *    about what the tour says.
