/**
 * Verifies `details` reports the values a union or enum admits from the
 * checker's resolved type, so the answer does not depend on how the declaration
 * is wrapped.
 *
 * `literals` was scraped out of the `signature` snippet, which stops after four
 * source lines or at the first `{`, and was then cut to six. So a union written
 * one member per line reported the first three of them, an enum written across
 * lines reported none at all, and `type Indirect = Kind | 'f'` reported `'f'`
 * alone while the members reaching it through `Kind` disappeared — all
 * silently, under an audit telling the caller these facts are compiler-resolved
 * (#732). This pins the whole class end to end, through the real binary: the
 * same type must answer the same way whatever its layout, and a type whose
 * members cannot all be named must report none rather than a subset that reads
 * as complete.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a project holding a wrapped union, a flat twin, a multi-line
 *    enum, an aliased union, and a union widened by `string`.
 * 2. Ask the MCP server for `details` on all five.
 * 3. Assert each value set is complete and layout-independent, that indirection
 *    resolves, and that the widened union reports nothing.
