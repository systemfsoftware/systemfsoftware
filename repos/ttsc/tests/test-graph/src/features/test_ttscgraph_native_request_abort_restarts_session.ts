/**
 * Verifies aborting an active native request retires and restarts its session.
 *
 * Cancellation cannot merely reject the caller while leaving the child alive:
 * that process can still emit the cancelled frame and its protocol position is
 * no longer trusted. The same reset path as timeout must be used.
 *
 * 1. Start a first-process-only hanging fake and wait until it is resident.
 * 2. Abort the active graph call and assert a cancellation error.
 * 3. Assert the old child exits and a later graph call succeeds on a replacement.
