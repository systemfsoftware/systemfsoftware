 * Verifies closing a native session terminates outstanding work exactly once.
 *
 * Ending stdin alone is insufficient for a child that has stopped reading it.
 * Close must reject active work, terminate the process, remain idempotent, and
 * prevent any queued or later call from respawning an orphan.
 *
 * 1. Start a hanging graph request and count how often it settles.
 * 2. Close twice and assert one rejection plus direct child termination.
 * 3. Assert pending state is empty and calls after close cannot spawn again.
