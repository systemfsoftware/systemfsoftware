/**
 * Verifies a dispatch hop is decided by what a declaration is, not by how many
 * modeled symbols its body happens to name.
 *
 * Body detection used to count outgoing `calls`/`accesses`/`instantiates`/
 * `renders` edges, which measures dependency degree instead. That is wrong in
 * both directions: an implementation whose body is empty, returns a literal,
 * throws, or only moves locals around scored zero and was refused as a dispatch
 * target, so the trace dead-ended on the declaration and reported nothing was
 * omitted; and a concrete base method was promoted through its own override the
 * moment its body stopped naming anything the graph models, so two graphs
 * identical in every declaration fact answered differently because of one
 * statement inside a body. The declaration facts the fix reads — kind,
 * `abstract`/`declare` modifiers, and interface or ambient ownership — are only
 * proven end to end through the real producer, which is why this runs the
 * shipped binary rather than a synthetic in-memory graph.
 *
 * 1. Materialize implementations that name nothing (empty, literal, local
 *    arithmetic, thrown literal) behind an interface member, an abstract
 *    method, and an ambient `declare class` member, plus two concrete bases
 *    with overrides that differ only in one statement, an abstract member
 *    standing between an interface and its concrete class, one implementation
 *    named in two heritage clauses, and an overload set.
 * 2. Trace forward from each caller through the real MCP launcher, and request the
 *    same continuation in path mode.
 * 3. Assert every genuinely bodyless declaration dispatches to its dependency-
 *    free implementation, that neither concrete base is promoted through its
 *    override, that no bodyless candidate is admitted as an implementation, and
 *    that `focus: "types"` still synthesizes nothing.
