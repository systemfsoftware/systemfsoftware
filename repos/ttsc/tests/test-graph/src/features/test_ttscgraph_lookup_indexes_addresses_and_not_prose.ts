/**
 * Verifies the citation index holds addresses and not the first word of
 * ordinary prose.
 *
 * Every tag TypeScript does not recognize reaches this index, and most of them
 * are not citations: `@todo`, `@remarks`, `@example`, and `@default` are
 * unknown to the compiler too. Keying on the leading token alone made `@todo
 * Add caching here` a carrier of the address `Add`, so a question opening with
 * that word answered with it — ranked above every real name match and labelled
 * a certain citation. A separator is what tells an address from a word.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a project with a real citation, a `@todo` opening with an English
 *    word, a `@default` holding a bare number, and a URL reference.
 * 2. Query the prose word, the number, the URL, and the real address.
 * 3. Assert only the addresses answer through the citation index, and that a prose
 *    word neither matches nor outranks an ordinary name hit.
