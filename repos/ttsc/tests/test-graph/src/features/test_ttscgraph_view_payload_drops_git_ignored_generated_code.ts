/**
 * Verifies the `view` reducer drops git-ignored generated code, as the guide
 * and the producer both promise.
 *
 * `packages/ttsc/internal/graph/gitignore.go` says "the full-graph dump drops
 * them from the viewer payload entirely" and the shipped viewer guide lists
 * "Git-ignored generated code is dropped" under what is left out. Both sibling
 * copies of this pure transform applied the filter; this one declared no
 * `ignored` field at all, so `ttsc-graph view` rendered a project's Prisma
 * client while the same dump uploaded to the website did not.
 *
 * The node cap makes the omission worse rather than containing it: the payload
 * is capped by degree, and generated clients are large and densely connected,
 * so they outrank authored code for the surviving slots.
 *
 * 1. Reduce a dump holding an authored node, a git-ignored generated node, and an
 *    external leaf.
 * 2. Assert only the authored node survives and the counts attribute each drop.
 * 3. Assert `keepIgnored` brings the generated node back, so the filter is a
 *    policy rather than a hard exclusion.
