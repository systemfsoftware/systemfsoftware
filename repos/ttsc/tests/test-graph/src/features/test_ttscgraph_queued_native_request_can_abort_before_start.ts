/**
 * Verifies a queued graph request can be cancelled before native work starts.
 *
 * Serialization must not turn cancellation into another wait behind the hung
 * head request. A queued caller should reject promptly without disturbing the
 * active child whose independent caller still owns it.
 *
 * 1. Hold the queue head in a hanging native request.
 * 2. Queue a signalled second call, abort it, and assert prompt rejection.
 * 3. Assert the first child remains alive until session close and no replacement
 *    spawned.
