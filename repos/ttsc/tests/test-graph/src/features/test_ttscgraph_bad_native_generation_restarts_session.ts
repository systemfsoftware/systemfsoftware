 * Verifies a false native generation digest retires the whole child.
 *
 * A shard manifest can be internally consistent while the advertised generation
 * is false. Accepting that coordinate would let the next delta claim a base the
 * client never proved, so the transaction is rejected before publication and
 * the process is replaced.
 *
 * 1. Make the first fake process publish valid shards under a false generation.
 * 2. Assert the call rejects and that child exits.
 * 3. Assert the next call starts a replacement process and succeeds.
