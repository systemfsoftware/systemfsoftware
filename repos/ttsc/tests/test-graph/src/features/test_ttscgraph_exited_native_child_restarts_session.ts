 * Verifies an early native child exit does not poison later graph requests.

 * The process can exit before or while Node completes the stdin write callback.
 * Both event orderings must settle the same pending owner once and leave the
 * serialized queue able to spawn a new process.
 *
 * 1. Make the first fake process exit with a non-zero status before responding.
 * 2. Assert the first graph call rejects through the child/write failure boundary.
 * 3. Assert a later call starts a second process and returns a graph.
