 * Verifies malformed native output retires the offending child before retry.

 * A framing failure is session-wide, not one bad request. Keeping that child
 * reusable allows its later bytes to corrupt a new call, so the next request
 * must begin on a different process generation.
 *
 * 1. Make the first fake process answer with invalid JSON and stay alive.
 * 2. Assert the call rejects and the offending process is terminated.
 * 3. Assert a later call spawns a replacement and succeeds.
