 * The graph launcher builds the TypeScript graph lazily on the first real graph
 * operation. A bad tsconfig would fail that load, so a successful escape proves
 * the escape branch returns before starting the native session or any graph
 * traversal.
 *
 * 1. Materialize a project with an intentionally invalid tsconfig.
 * 2. Initialize the MCP server and call only escape.
 * 3. Assert the tool succeeds and the process exits cleanly.
