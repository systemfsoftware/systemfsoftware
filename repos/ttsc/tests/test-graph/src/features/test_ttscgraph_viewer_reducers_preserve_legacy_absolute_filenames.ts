 * reducers. The root must be a source directory rather than a complete file;
 * Windows paths compare case-insensitively, POSIX paths remain case-sensitive,
 * and current project-relative dumps must bypass rerooting entirely.
 *
 * 1. Load all three production reducer copies through Node's TypeScript loader.
 * 2. Exercise single-file, repeated-file, nested, POSIX, drive, and UNC paths.
 * 3. Assert IDs and files retain their spellings, and that both copies apply the
