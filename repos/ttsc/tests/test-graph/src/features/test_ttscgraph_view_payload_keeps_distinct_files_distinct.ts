/**
 * Verifies the viewer projection keeps two distinct files distinct.
 *
 * The reduction rewrites node ids with the display path it computes, so a
 * non-injective projection does not merely mislabel — two declarations in two
 * files become one node, and an edge drawn between them resolves back to the
 * wrong end. The old fallback collapsed anything outside the common root to its
 * basename, which two shapes reach: disjoint absolute roots, and the mixed path
 * forms one valid project can emit, where the common root comes out empty and
 * every relative file falls through to its basename.
 *
 * 1. Reduce a dump whose two files share a basename under disjoint roots.
 * 2. Reduce a dump mixing an absolute file with two relative ones sharing a
 *    basename.
 * 3. Assert both keep two nodes with distinct ids and a resolvable edge.
