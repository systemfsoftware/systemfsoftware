Bring TypeScript-Go and supported [`ttsc`](https://ttsc.dev) plugin features into one VS Code session.

The extension keeps TypeScript-Go completion and diagnostics in one `ttscserver` stream with `@ttsc/lint` diagnostics, suggestions, fix-all actions, formatting, and completion published by lint project rules.

Use it when the project already runs `ttsc`. Add `@ttsc/lint` when you also want lint diagnostics, fix-all actions, and formatting in the editor.

## Requirements

- **VS Code** 1.94 or later.
- **Node.js** 18 or later.
- A workspace with `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`.
- Project-installed `ttsc`, `typescript`, and the `ttsc` plugins you want editor diagnostics from.

Install the common project dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D ttsc typescript @ttsc/lint
```

`@ttsc/lint` is optional for TypeScript-Go language features, but required for the lint and format commands shown below.

## Install

Install from the VS Code Marketplace by searching `ttsc` and choosing the extension by `samchon`.

From a shell, the short installer is:

```bash
npx @ttsc/vscode
```

The direct VS Code CLI form is:

```bash
code --install-extension samchon.ttsc
```

To uninstall the npm-installed copy:

```bash
npx @ttsc/vscode uninstall
```

Both shell commands use the `code` CLI. If it isn't on your `PATH`, run **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** from VS Code's command palette.

## Configuration

### `lint.config.ts`

At the project root, this drives both the lint rules and the formatter. Without it the extension still type-checks, but `@ttsc/lint` diagnostics and formatting do nothing:

```ts
// lint.config.ts
import type { ITtscLintConfig } from "@ttsc/lint";

export default {
  rules: {
    "no-var": "error",
    "prefer-const": "error",
    "typescript/no-explicit-any": "warning",
    "typescript/no-floating-promises": "error",
  },
  format: {
    printWidth: 100,
    singleQuote: true,
    trailingComma: "all",
  },
} satisfies ITtscLintConfig;
```

### `.vscode/settings.json`

Set `samchon.ttsc` as the default formatter and turn on `editor.formatOnSave`:

```jsonc
{
  "[typescript][typescriptreact]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "samchon.ttsc",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  }
}
```

Lint fixes stay off-save by default because they can change code meaning. Run `ttsc: Fix all lint issues` from the command palette, or opt in on manual saves:

```jsonc
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.ttsc": "explicit"
  }
}
```

## What it adds

- TypeScript-Go diagnostics, hover, navigation, and completions.
- `@ttsc/lint` diagnostics, suggestions, code actions, and `source.fixAll.ttsc`.
- JSDoc completion from a built-in lint rule and project-indexed completion from contributor rules that publish it.
- Diagnostics reported by other LSP-capable `ttsc` plugins.
- `ttsc: Fix all lint issues`, `ttsc: Format document`, and `ttsc: Restart language server` in the command palette.
- Format on save with the `format` block from `lint.config.*`.
- Multi-root workspace support. Each package can use its own `ttsc`, `typescript`, `tsconfig.json`, and `lint.config.*`.

Save the file before relying on lint diagnostics or running the command-palette lint and format commands. Format-on-save works on the live editor buffer.

Completion uses the live editor buffer. Enable `jsdoc/check-tag-names` to try built-in lint completion inside a `/** ... */` block. The [Lint in VS Code guide](https://ttsc.dev/docs/lint/editor) covers that workflow and contributor project indexes.

## Troubleshooting

No diagnostics? Work through these in order:

1. Confirm the workspace has a `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`.
2. Confirm `ttsc` resolves in the project: `npx ttsc --version`.
3. Confirm the project itself checks: `npx ttsc --noEmit`.
4. Open **View → Output → ttsc** and read the server log.
5. For full LSP tracing, set `ttsc.trace.server` to `"verbose"`, then run **Developer: Set Log Level...**, select **ttsc (trace)**, and choose **Trace**. Tracing starts immediately; do not reload the window.

If diagnostics work but lint completion does not, press Ctrl+Space after `@` inside a JSDoc block. After changing the lint config or project-indexed inputs, save the file: the completion corpus is rediscovered in the background on save. `ttsc: Restart language server` is still needed for a completion trigger character the session never advertised, which the **ttsc** output channel names when it appears.
