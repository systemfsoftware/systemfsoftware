/**
 * Create a {@link TemplateMiddle}: a span of a template expression that sits
 * between two substitutions, from one `}` to the next `${`.
 *
 * The `text` is the cooked content of that span. The optional `rawText` carries
 * the source spelling before escape processing; the printer emits it verbatim
 * when present, and otherwise escapes the cooked `text` so it re-parses to the
 * same value. A middle span only appears in a template literal that has two or
 * more substitutions, and it is one piece of that larger literal rather than a
 * complete expression.
 *
 * The printer emits the closing `}` of the preceding substitution, the content,
 * then the `${` that opens the next one. With `text` of `mid`, this prints:
 *
 * ```ts
 * }mid${
 * ```
