// TestUnicornNumberLiteralCaseFixesEveryLiteralInOnePass verifies a file
// holding several non-canonical literals is fully normalized by a single fix
// pass, and that the canonical literals between them are left alone.
//
// Every finding contributes its own TextEdit, and `applyTextEditsToFile`
// applies the batch right-to-left against one snapshot of the source. A fix
// whose range drifted past its literal would shift the offsets of its
// neighbours and corrupt the file, which a single-literal snapshot can never
// expose.
//
//  1. Write a source mixing uppercase-exponent, mis-cased hex, BigInt, and
//     already-canonical literals — two of them on the same line.
//  2. Run the rule through the native fix applier once.
//  3. Assert every non-canonical literal is rewritten and nothing else moved.
