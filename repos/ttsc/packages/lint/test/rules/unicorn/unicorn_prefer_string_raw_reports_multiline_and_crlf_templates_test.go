// TestUnicornPreferStringRawReportsMultilineAndCrlfTemplates verifies a
// no-substitution template keeps reporting across line breaks.
//
// Upstream's line check belongs to its `Literal` handler alone: a template
// already carries its newlines literally, so `String.raw` reproduces them and
// the multi-line case stays reportable. Applying the string-literal guards
// wholesale to both node kinds would silence it. The CRLF twin pins the raw
// payload's LF normalization — the scanner cooks <CRLF> to <LF>, so a raw
// payload read verbatim out of a CRLF file would never match its own cooked
// value and the rule would go silent on Windows checkouts.
//
//  1. Write a two-line template whose only escapes are `\\` separators.
//  2. Repeat the fixture with CRLF line endings.
//  3. Assert both report exactly once, on the template's opening line.
