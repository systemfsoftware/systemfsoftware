// TestUnicornNumberLiteralCaseFixesBigintAndSeparatedLiterals verifies the
// BigInt `n` suffix and ES2021 numeric separators survive the fix untouched.
//
// The suffix is the trap: JavaScript accepts only a lowercase `n`, so a fixer
// that uppercased the whole hex tail would emit `0xFFN` and turn valid source
// into a syntax error. Upstream sidesteps it by canonicalizing the number part
// alone and re-appending the suffix, and the `_` separators must likewise pass
// through as literal bytes rather than be treated as digits.
//
//  1. Declare a const initialized to a mis-cased BigInt or separated literal.
//  2. Run the rule through the native fix applier.
//  3. Assert the digits are canonical while `n` stays lowercase and every `_`
//     stays exactly where it was.
