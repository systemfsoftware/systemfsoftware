// TestRuleCorpusNoEmptyNamedBlocks verifies the lint rule corpus fixture
// no-empty-named-blocks.ts.
//
// Empty named clauses come in three syntactic shapes the rule must catch:
// a bare `import {} from "x"`, a default-binding-plus-empty-clause
// `import name, {} from "x"`, and a bare `export {}`. None of them
// introduce a binding; the first two leave only the side-effect load
// (which a bare `import "x"` expresses without the empty braces), and the
// third either restates module-ness redundantly or marks an otherwise
// non-module file in a way that has cleaner alternatives.
//
// 1. Load the annotated TypeScript fixture source embedded below.
// 2. Enable the rule severities declared by its // expect: comments.
// 3. Assert the native Engine reports exactly the annotated diagnostics.
