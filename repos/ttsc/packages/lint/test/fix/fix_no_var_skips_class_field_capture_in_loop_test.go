// TestFixNoVarSkipsClassFieldCaptureInLoop verifies no-var declines the fix
// for a loop-local `var` referenced from a class field initializer inside the
// loop.
//
// An instance field initializer is deferred code: it runs at construction
// time and closes over the class definition's environment exactly like a
// method body. A class created per iteration therefore shares one `var`
// binding across all its instances but would capture a fresh per-iteration
// `let` binding, so the loop-closure decline must treat PropertyDeclaration
// as a capture boundary, not only function-like bodies.
//
//  1. Parse a for-of body declaring `var x` and pushing `class { p = x }`.
//  2. Run the no-var fixer through the disk-backed applier.
//  3. Assert at least one finding fired but zero fixes were applied.
