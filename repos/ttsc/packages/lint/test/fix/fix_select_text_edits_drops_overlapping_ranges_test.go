// TestFixSelectTextEditsDropsOverlappingRanges verifies overlap policy.
//
// `selectTextEdits` is the gate that prevents two rule fixes from clobbering
// each other when their edit ranges intersect. The policy is "first one in
// sort order wins" so the function must drop any edit whose start sits before
// the previously-accepted edit's end.
//
// 1. Build two edits whose ranges overlap on a shared source position.
// 2. Run `selectTextEdits` against the synthetic source length.
// 3. Assert only the earlier-starting edit survives.
