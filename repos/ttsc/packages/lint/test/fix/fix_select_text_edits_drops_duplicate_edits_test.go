// TestFixSelectTextEditsDropsDuplicateEdits verifies dedup independent of overlap.
//
// selectTextEdits keeps the source single-pass deterministic by deduping
// byte-identical edits before the overlap filter runs. The dedup branch
// composes with sort stability, so a refactor that swaps the `seen` key
// shape or replaces the map with a position-only set must not change the
// surviving-edit count under identical inputs.
//
//  1. Build three edits where the first two are byte-identical and the third
//     targets a disjoint range.
//  2. Run `selectTextEdits` against a synthetic source length.
//  3. Assert exactly two edits survive and both ranges are accounted for.
