// TestFormatSemiPreferNeverKeepsSemiBeforeASIHazard verifies the rule
// refuses to strip a trailing `;` when the next statement starts with
// an ASI-hazard token.
//
// `const a = b` followed by `;[1, 2].forEach(…)` parses as two
// statements because of the explicit terminator. Removing the `;`
// would re-associate the `[1, 2]` as a member-access on `b`, changing
// program semantics. The rule's fixer applies to one statement at a
// time and cannot synthesize prettier's defensive leading-`;` on the
// next line, so it conservatively keeps the terminator instead of
// stripping it.
//
//  1. Parse a two-statement source where the second statement starts
//     with `[`.
//  2. Run formatSemi configured `prefer: "never"`.
//  3. Assert zero findings — the hazard guard kept the first `;` in
//     place.
