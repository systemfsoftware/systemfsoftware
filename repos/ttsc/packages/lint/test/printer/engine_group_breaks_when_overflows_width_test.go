// TestEngineGroupBreaksWhenOverflowsWidth verifies a Group whose flat
// projection would overflow the column budget renders Lines as
// newline+indent and Softlines as newline+indent.
//
// This is the break branch — the entire premise of printWidth-style
// reflow. The fixture uses a deliberately tight budget (printWidth=4)
// so a two-fragment group is forced to break even though the flat
// rendering would only be 7 characters wide.
//
//  1. Build the same Group as the fit case (two Texts joined by Line).
//  2. Print under printWidth=4 to force a break.
//  3. Assert the result is `foo\nbar`, i.e. broken with zero indent.
