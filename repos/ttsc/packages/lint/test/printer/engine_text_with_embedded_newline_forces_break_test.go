// TestEngineTextWithEmbeddedNewlineForcesBreak verifies a Text whose
// payload spans multiple lines forces every enclosing Group into
// broken mode regardless of the column budget.
//
// The flat form of such a Text is multi-line by definition: it
// already contains the newline that the engine is asking
// "can this fit on one line?" about. A regression that returned
// `true` from `fits()` on multi-line Text would let surrounding
// groups commit to flat layouts whose rendered output already had
// newlines embedded — the resulting flat-but-multi-line shape would
// silently corrupt every fit decision touching a multi-line verbatim
// slice (long callees, template literals, JSX text).
//
//  1. Build a Group whose first Text payload contains a newline and
//     whose second Text payload is short.
//  2. Print under a wide printWidth=80 — flat form would otherwise
//     fit comfortably.
//  3. Assert the surrounding group broke (Line emits a newline + indent),
//     proving fits() refused to accept the multi-line Text as flat.
