A linter and formatter. Co-protagonist of the [`ttsc`](https://ttsc.dev) toolchain, paired with `ttsc`, it replaces `eslint` and covers most of `prettier`.

720+ rules across 21 families. Lint violations surface as `error TSxxxxx` from a single compile pass; the formatter applies via `ttsc format`.

## Demonstration

Given this file:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
var x: number = 3;
let y: number = 4;
const z: string = 5;

console.log(x + y + z);
```

Run `ttsc` with `@ttsc/lint` enabled (see [Setup](#setup)):

```bash
$ pnpm ttsc
src/index.ts:3:7 - error TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.

3 const z: string = 5;
        ~

src/index.ts:2:5 - error TS17397: [prefer-const] Use const instead of let.

2 let y: number = 4;
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

src/index.ts:1:1 - error TS11966: [no-var] Unexpected var, use let or const instead.

1 var x: number = 3;
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Found 3 errors in the same file, starting at: src/index.ts:3
```

Type errors (`TS2322`) and lint violations (`TS17397`, `TS11966`) come out together. No second tool, no second CI step.

## Diagnostic code compatibility

Every built-in rule has a unique positive numeric code in the reserved `TS9000` through `TS17999` band. These assignments are kept in an append-only ledger: adding a built-in rule does not renumber existing rules, and a removed rule's code is not reused. The LSP surface continues to expose the rule ID, such as `no-var`, in its diagnostic `code` field.

The ledger introduction preserved every legacy code that was already unique. For each pre-existing collision group, the alphabetically first rule kept the shared legacy code and every other rule received an available code. Those resolved assignments are now frozen by the same append-only policy.

Rules contributed by another Go package share the same collision-free band. Their codes are deterministic for an unchanged complete set of loaded contributors and do not depend on registration order. Adding or removing a contributor recomputes assignments for that complete contributor set and can change contributor codes, but never changes a built-in assignment.

## Setup

```bash
npm install -D ttsc @ttsc/lint typescript
```

Drop a `lint.config.ts` next to your `tsconfig.json`:

```ts
// lint.config.ts
import type { ITtscLintConfig } from "@ttsc/lint";

export default {
  format: {
    printWidth: 100,
    singleQuote: true,
    trailingComma: "all",
  },
  rules: {
    "no-var": "error",
    "prefer-const": "error",
    "typescript/no-explicit-any": "error",
    "typescript/no-floating-promises": "error",
  },
} satisfies ITtscLintConfig;
```

Run your normal `ttsc` or `ttsx`:

```bash
npx ttsc
npx ttsx src/index.ts
```

Errors fail the command; warnings print without affecting the exit code. Under `ttsx`, errors stop the program before your entrypoint runs.

`ttsc fix` applies every autofix the enabled rules offer, lint and format together. Writes results back to disk, then re-runs type-check + lint. `ttsc format` runs the format rule set through the same dataflow.

```bash
npx ttsc fix
npx ttsc format
```

`ttsc fix` is a one-shot project pass and rejects `--watch`, single-file mode, and `--emit`. Fixes are written to disk before the recheck runs, so source stays modified even when the command exits non-zero on remaining errors. Recommended flow: run `ttsc fix` locally, commit, then have CI run `ttsc --noEmit` to gate on zero remaining errors.

## Format

Configure the formatter through the `format` block in `lint.config.ts`. Keys mirror `.prettierrc`; the presence of the block, even empty `format: {}`, enables the always-on format rules at Prettier defaults so `ttsc format` rewrites your source to match.

One boundary to know before you drop `prettier`: no pass normalizes the whitespace between two tokens, so `a=1`, `if(x){`, and `const i : number` are left as written. See [Format → Scope](https://ttsc.dev/docs/lint/format#scope).

```ts
// lint.config.ts
import type { ITtscLintConfig } from "@ttsc/lint";

export default {
  format: {
    printWidth: 100,
    singleQuote: true,
    trailingComma: "all",
    sortImports: {
      order: ["<BUILTIN_MODULES>", "", "<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>", "", "^[./]"],
      unsafeSortRuntimeImports: true, // accepts module evaluation reordering
    },
    jsDoc: true,
  },
  rules: { "no-var": "error" },
} satisfies ITtscLintConfig;
```

`ttsc check` does **not** fail on formatting by default. It surfaces format diagnostics only when you opt in with `format.severity`. `ttsc format` runs the active format rules across the project and writes results to disk regardless of `severity`.

Each `format` key controls one behavior:

| Config key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `severity` (default `"off"`) | Check-time diagnostic level for formatting. Does not gate `ttsc format`. |
| `semi` | Insert trailing semicolons on ASI-terminated statements, and own the member separator in interface, type-literal, mapped-type, and class bodies. |
| `singleQuote` | Convert quoted strings to the preferred quote style. |
| `arrowParens` | Add or remove parens around a single arrow parameter. |
| `bracketSpacing` | Spaces inside object and named-import/export braces. |
| `quoteProps` | Quote or unquote object property keys. |
| `trailingComma` | Add trailing commas to multi-line lists. |
| `printWidth`, `tabWidth`, `useTabs`, `endOfLine` | Column-aware line reflow. Object/array literals, call/new arguments, and named import/export clauses break across lines when their flat form overflows the budget. |
| `sortImports` (opt-in) | Sort named specifiers and erased type-only imports. Runtime declaration sorting requires `unsafeSortRuntimeImports`. |
| `jsDoc` (on by default) | Normalize JSDoc blocks toward [prettier-plugin-jsdoc](https://github.com/hosseinmd/prettier-plugin-jsdoc). |

`sortImports` is **opt-in** — it takes effect only when you set it. Every other key takes effect as soon as the `format` block is present (JSDoc normalization included; set `jsDoc: false` to opt out), which also applies several keyless layout behaviors (statement splitting, indentation, whitespace normalization, clause joining, continuation-keyword placement, declaration-header reflow, ternary-nullish parens, leading-semicolon merging, and parameter-property breaking).

The safe default preserves the source order of every runtime-bearing import, including default, namespace, named, and bare imports, because each form can evaluate its dependency module. It still alphabetizes named specifiers within one declaration and can sort or merge a block made entirely of erased `import type` declarations. Set `unsafeSortRuntimeImports: true` only when every dependency in the block is order-independent. `combineTypeAndValue` affects a mixed type/value block only under that unsafe opt-in.

Formatting is configured **only** through the `format` block. The `rules` map is for lint rules; a `format/*` id placed there is ignored. To turn a format behavior off, set its `format` key (for example `trailingComma: "none"`), not a `rules` entry.

## Rules

Lint rules are off until you enable them in `lint.config.ts`. Severity values: `"error"` fails the build, `"warning"` prints without affecting the exit code, `"off"` disables the rule.

```ts
// lint.config.ts
export default {
  rules: {
    "no-var": "error",
    "eqeqeq": "error",
    "prefer-template": "warning",
    "typescript/no-non-null-assertion": "off",
  },
} satisfies ITtscLintConfig;
```

Rules with options use an ESLint-style tuple such as `["error", { allowElseIf: false }]`. A built-in rule whose typed setting is severity-only accepts no payload, even while it is `"off"`; the engine reports an invalid configuration instead of silently discarding the extra value.

Rule IDs use ESLint-style kebab-case and slash namespaces, `no-var`, `react/jsx-key`, `testing-library/prefer-screen-queries`. The exported `ITtscLintRules` type is the intersection of family-specific interfaces such as `ITtscLintCoreRules`, `ITtscLintTypeScriptRules`, `ITtscLintReactRules`, and `ITtscLintVitestRules`, so users can type a whole config or a narrower family-shaped object.

Each rule below links to its TypeScript fixture under [`tests/test-lint/src/cases/`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/tree/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases).

<!--
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS, adding a new rule family or a new rule.

Family section shape (one `### <Family display name>` heading per family, alphabetical
by display name):

    ### <Family display name>

    <One-sentence summary of what this family covers, the "what".>

    <One short paragraph elaborating, the "why" / scope notes / known limits.>

    Source: [`<upstream-package>`](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>), [optional second source](https://…).

    - [`<rule-id>`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/<fixture-name>.ts): <short description ending in a period>.

Rules:

- Bullet shape is `- [\`<rule-id>\`](url): description.`: colon as separator, lowercase
  description, ending in a period. No em-dash separator. Bullets sort alphabetically
  by rule id within the family.
- The fixture path is `tests/test-lint/src/cases/<rule-id>.ts` for core rules,
  `tests/test-lint/src/cases/<family>-<rule-id>.ts(x)` for namespaced families
  (`.tsx` only when the snippet uses JSX). Create the fixture before linking.
- Do NOT put license parentheticals on the `Source:` line (e.g. ` (MIT)`,
  ` (BSD-3-Clause)`). Reader can click the link and see for themselves.
- Do NOT mention Go test files. Every bullet links to a `tests/test-lint/src/cases/`
  fixture; if a fixture does not exist yet, create one before adding the bullet.
- Update both this README **and** `website/src/content/docs/lint/rules/<family>.mdx`
  in the same change. The mdx file uses the same colon form (`- \`<rule-id>\`: <desc>.`)
  with no em-dashes; keep the rule list in sync between the two.
- After landing the bullet, append the upstream plugin link to the `## References`
  section below and update its `### Claim ownership` paragraph if a new family
  joined the family list.

### ESLint core

Generic ESLint-compatible rules that apply to both JavaScript and TypeScript source. Every rule listed here corresponds 1-to-1 with an ESLint core rule of the same kebab-case id, so projects migrating from ESLint can paste their rule severities into `lint.config.ts` without renaming anything. TypeScript-only rules and `@typescript-eslint` extensions live under `typescript/*` in [TypeScript](#typescript), `@ttsc/lint` does not accept legacy bare names or `@typescript-eslint/*` aliases for those.

### TypeScript

TypeScript-only rules and `@typescript-eslint` plugin equivalents, exposed under the `typescript/*` namespace. Each rule either requires TypeScript syntax (interface, `enum`, `namespace`, `as`, `!`, `import type`, type parameters, declaration merging, parameter properties, triple-slash references) or originates from `@typescript-eslint` as a TS-aware extension that has no counterpart in plain ESLint.

### React

React TSX rules, Hooks correctness, JSX safety, the React Compiler subset, and Fast Refresh export shape. Bundles rules from three upstream plugins under one `react/*` namespace, matching Oxlint's layout. Performance-only rules live in [React performance](#react-performance) because they are opt-in toggles rather than correctness checks.

### React performance

Detects freshly-allocated reference values (arrays, objects, functions, JSX elements) passed as JSX props. A new reference invalidates `React.memo` / `useMemo` shallow checks on every render. Useful for performance-critical render paths; usually unnecessary for top-level pages. Diagnostics only fire on `.tsx` source files, JSX heuristics rely on the file extension, so `.ts` files are skipped even when they contain JSX-like syntax.

### JSX accessibility

JSX accessibility rules applied to TSX (and JSX-in-TS) sources. Checks the static structure of JSX elements against WAI-ARIA authoring guidance, interactive controls should be focusable, labels should reference a control, ARIA properties should match the element role, and so on. Runtime accessibility issues require live audits; this family catches the statically-decidable subset. Component alias settings, router-specific anchor settings, and autofixes are deferred.

### Next.js

Next.js framework rules applied to TypeScript and TSX sources inside Next.js apps. Cover static TS/TSX Next.js source patterns the framework's runtime treats as load-bearing, pages/app routing, `<Head>` placement, font and script loading, image and link components, and common data export typos. Rules that need non-TypeScript files or runtime filesystem route discovery are intentionally conservative.

Source: [`@next/eslint-plugin-next`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/eslint-plugin-next).

- [`nextjs/google-font-display`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/nextjs-google-font-display.tsx): require `font-display` query on Google Font `<link>` URLs so initial render is not blocked.

### Solid

Solid TSX rules. Solid components compile to fine-grained reactivity, so patterns that look correct in React (destructuring props, calling `useEffect`-style hooks with array deps) silently break reactivity in Solid. AST-only, high-confidence Solid patterns after a Solid import is present.

- [`solid/prefer-classlist`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/solid-prefer-classlist.tsx): prefer the `classList` JSX prop over `clsx`/`classnames` calls.

### Jest

Jest test source rules. Apply to TypeScript test files that use the Jest runner (`describe`, `test`/`it`, `expect`, lifecycle hooks). Guard test-quality patterns the type system cannot detect, unended assertions, focused tests left behind, duplicate hook calls.

Source: [`eslint-plugin-jest`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest).

### Vitest

Vitest test source rules. Vitest reuses much of Jest's testing surface but ships its own runner and configuration. These rules mirror the ergonomic subset of `eslint-plugin-jest` adapted for Vitest semantics, focused or disabled tests, duplicate titles, missing or conditional assertions, standalone `expect` calls, done callbacks, invalid `expect` chains, invalid titles, returned test values, and `.length` assertions that should use `toHaveLength`.

### Playwright

Playwright end-to-end test rules applied to TypeScript test files driven by the `@playwright/test` runner. Guard Playwright-specific patterns, locator usage, web-first assertions, focused/slowed tests. That would otherwise compile and run silently.

### Cypress

Cypress end-to-end test rules. Apply to TypeScript/TSX sources that use the Cypress runner (`cy.*` commands and Mocha-style `describe`/`it` blocks). Detect Cypress-specific anti-patterns such as async test bodies, missing assertions before screenshots, or deprecated XPath selectors.

Source: [`eslint-plugin-cypress`](https://github.com/cypress-io/eslint-plugin-cypress).

### Storybook

Storybook CSF and configuration rules. Apply to `*.stories.ts(x)` and `.storybook/main.ts` files. Cover CSF metadata shape, named story exports, deprecated `storiesOf`, interaction-test imports, direct renderer-package imports, and addon installation checks. `storybook/no-uninstalled-addons` accepts `{ packageJsonLocation?: string; ignore?: string[] }`; without an explicit path it walks upward from the linted Storybook config file to find `package.json`.

Source: [`eslint-plugin-storybook`](https://github.com/storybookjs/eslint-plugin-storybook).

### TanStack Query

TanStack Query rules. Guard the ergonomic and correctness contracts of TanStack Query (`useQuery`, `useMutation`, query-options factories) inside React TypeScript sources.

Source: [`@tanstack/eslint-plugin-query`](https://github.com/TanStack/query/tree/main/packages/eslint-plugin-query).

### Promise

Promise correctness and style rules. Check the chain shape of Promise-using code: every chain ends with `catch`, no callback inside a `then`, no nested `.then().then()`, and so on. AST-local only, type-aware Promise checks belong with `typescript/*` checker rules.

Source: [`eslint-plugin-promise`](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-promise).

- [`promise/always-return`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/promise-always-return.ts): require `.then(...)` callbacks to return a value or throw.

### Unicorn

Modernization and style rules spanning array iteration, string and regex idioms, Node.js APIs, error handling, module syntax, DOM APIs, and code shape. Rewrite legacy patterns into their modern counterparts (`for...of` over `forEach`, `Array#flatMap` over `map().flat()`, `String#replaceAll` over a global-regex `replace`, `Math.trunc` over `| 0`), forbid known anti-patterns (`null` literals, abusive `eslint-disable`, `new Buffer`, `process.exit`, `instanceof Array`), and pin a consistent style for things [ESLint core](#eslint-core) and [TypeScript](#typescript) leave underspecified (filename case, numeric separators, catch-binding names, expiring TODOs, escape-sequence case, switch-case braces). Most rules are pure AST checks; binding-aware rules use the TypeScript checker when lexical identity is part of the contract.

Source: [`eslint-plugin-unicorn`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn).

- [`unicorn/string-content`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/unicorn-string-content.ts): rewrite configured `patterns` inside string literals and template quasis (e.g., curly quotes for straight ones); no default patterns, per-pattern `suggest` / `fix` / `caseSensitive` / `message`, and AST-selector targeting.

- [`unicorn/throw-new-error`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/unicorn-throw-new-error.ts): require `throw new Error(...)` over `throw Error(...)`.

### Regular expressions

Regex-shape rules. Check the structure of regex literals, emptiness, uselessness, flag ordering, shorthand classes, Unicode support. Some rules supersede the regex-related rules in [ESLint core](#eslint-core); both ids exist so projects can keep the legacy ESLint names alongside the regexp-plugin variants.

### JSDoc

Documentation-comment validation rules. Bundles `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` content checks (tag names, parameter coverage, descriptions) with the lone `eslint-plugin-tsdoc` syntax check (`jsdoc/tsdoc-syntax`). Both target `/** ... */` comments. Formatting concerns (alignment, indentation) are configured through the top-level [`format`](#format) block, not here.

### Functional

Functional-programming policy rules. Push code toward immutability, side-effect-free expressions, and expression-style control flow. Most rules are useful in pieces, projects rarely enable the whole family at `"error"`. Enabling the whole set together expresses a strict functional-core / imperative-shell discipline. Diagnostic-only: `ttsc fix` does not rewrite mutation, classes, exceptions, loops, or branching into a functional design.

Source: [`eslint-plugin-functional`](https://github.com/eslint-functional/eslint-plugin-functional).

Recommended preset for projects committing to the discipline:

```ts
// lint.config.ts
export default {
  rules: {
    "functional/no-let": "error",
    "functional/no-loop-statements": "error",
    "functional/no-conditional-statements": "error",

### Architecture boundaries

Architecture-boundary rules enforce import direction and module visibility between configured source-path _elements_ (layers, features, apps in a monorepo). Every rule operates on the _resolved source file_ of an import, relative imports are followed to the real `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.d.ts` file before classification. Boundary diagnostics do not offer autofixes, a violation usually needs an API or architecture decision, not a mechanical import rewrite.

Source: ported from [`eslint-plugin-boundaries`](https://github.com/javierbrea/eslint-plugin-boundaries).

Example configuration:

```ts
// lint.config.ts
export default {
  rules: {
    "boundaries/element-types": ["error", {
      elements: [
        { type: "app", pattern: "src/app/**" },
        { type: "domain", pattern: "src/domain/**", entry: "index.ts", private: "internal/**" },
      ],
      rules: [{ from: "app", disallow: "domain" }],
    }],
    "boundaries/entry-point": ["error", {
      elements: [{ type: "domain", pattern: "src/domain/**", entry: "index.ts" }],
    }],
    "boundaries/no-private": ["error", {
      elements: [{ type: "domain", pattern: "src/domain/**", private: "internal/**" }],
    }],
    "boundaries/no-unknown": ["error", {
      elements: [
        { type: "app", pattern: "src/app/**" },
        { type: "domain", pattern: "src/domain/**" },
      ],
    }],
    "boundaries/external": ["error", { disallow: ["@legacy/sdk"] }],
  },
} satisfies ITtscLintConfig;
```

- [`boundaries/dependencies`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/boundaries-dependencies.ts): unified dependency-direction rule from upstream `eslint-plugin-boundaries`, intended to replace `element-types` / `entry-point` / `external` / `no-private` / `no-unknown` with a single policy block.
- [`boundaries/element-types`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/boundaries-element-types.ts): enforces allowed dependency directions between configured source-path element types.
- [`boundaries/entry-point`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/boundaries-entry-point.ts): requires imports into an element to target its configured public entry files.
- [`boundaries/external`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/boundaries-external.ts): restricts external package imports by package/specifier pattern.
- [`boundaries/no-private`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/boundaries-no-private.ts): rejects imports of configured private files from outside their element.
- [`boundaries/no-unknown`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/blob/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases/boundaries-no-unknown.ts): rejects relative imports whose resolved source file matches no configured element.

## Third-party rule plugins

Other npm packages can ship lint rules that compile into the same `@ttsc/lint` binary and report through the same diagnostic stream as built-ins. Declare them in `lint.config.ts`:

```ts
// lint.config.ts
import demoPlugin from "ttsc-lint-plugin-demo";
import type { ITtscLintConfig } from "@ttsc/lint";

export default {
  plugins: { demo: demoPlugin },
  rules: { "demo/no-todo-comment": "error" },
} satisfies ITtscLintConfig;
```

`ttsc` copies each declared contributor's Go source into a sub-package of `@ttsc/lint`'s module at build time, so the resulting binary has both built-in and contributor rules registered before `main`. Authoring instructions and the public Go API live in the [`@ttsc/lint` walkthrough → How a contributor package ships](https://ttsc.dev/docs/development/walkthroughs/lint#how-a-contributor-package-ships).

Contributor rules emit autofixes the same way built-ins do, call `ctx.ReportFix(node, message, edits...)` or `ctx.ReportRangeFix(pos, end, message, edits...)`. The `rule/astutil` package re-exports the byte-range helpers built-ins use (`NodeText`, `KeywordStart`, `FindKeyword`, `TokenRange`). See the [contributor autofix path](https://ttsc.dev/docs/development/walkthroughs/lint#the-contributor-autofix-path) section for the full contract and an example.

Contributor rules run on declaration files (`.d.ts`) by default. The engine skips its own value-level rules there — executable grammar cannot appear in a declaration file — but it cannot infer a third-party rule's shape, so contributors keep the conservative default. A rule that only inspects executable code can implement the optional `rule.DeclarationFileRule` marker (`VisitsDeclarationFiles() bool { return false }`) to get the same skip and save the dispatch on declaration-heavy projects.

Contributor rules also keep accepting options by default because `rule.Context.Options` predates the options-capability contract. A contributor that is genuinely optionless can implement `rule.OptionsRule` with `AcceptsTtscLintOptions() bool { return false }`; the host then rejects any payload before calling the rule. The domain-specific method name avoids capturing an unrelated `AcceptsOptions` method on an existing contributor. The same marker applies to `rule.ProjectRule` implementations.

A typed contributor package should publish the same optionless contract by augmenting `ITtscLintContributorRules` directly with `TtscLintRuleSetting`. Without this augmentation, the open contributor fallback keeps accepting an unknown payload for packages whose typings were not imported.

```ts
import type { TtscLintRuleSetting } from "@ttsc/lint";

declare module "@ttsc/lint" {
  interface ITtscLintContributorRules {
    "demo/capitalize-exports"?: TtscLintRuleSetting;
  }
}
```

### Project-scoped contributor rules

Contributors that validate the loaded Program rather than individual AST nodes can register a public `rule.ProjectRule`:

```go
type noCycles struct{}

func (noCycles) Name() string { return "architecture/no-cycles" }
func (noCycles) Check(ctx *rule.ProjectContext) {
  // ctx.Sources is the user-source set the host read: the tsconfig file list
  // plus every TypeScript source the Program reached through an import, and it
  // may be empty. ctx.Checker is the Program checker, and ctx.Identity keeps
  // logical and physical project paths separate.
  if cycle := findCycle(ctx.Sources, ctx.Checker); cycle != "" {
    ctx.Report(cycle)
  }
}

func init() { rule.RegisterProject(noCycles{}) }
```

Each project rule runs once per loaded Program, before file rules. `ctx.Identity` includes the invocation cwd, logical and physical config paths and roots, an optional explicit project root, the plugin-config origin, and a lifecycle id. `Report` marks the rule failed and emits one project finding; `Fail` marks it failed without a finding. Later file rules can call `ctx.ProjectResult(name)` and distinguish `absent`, `off`, `not_evaluated`, `passed`, and `failed`.

When a project rule reads local files outside the TypeScript Program, implement `rule.ProjectInputRule` so watch and editor hosts can observe exactly those inputs:

```go
func (evidenceRule) ProjectInputs(ctx *rule.ProjectInputContext) []rule.ProjectInput {
  var options struct {
    Markdown []string `json:"markdown"`
    OpenAPI  string   `json:"openapi"`
  }
  if err := ctx.DecodeOptions(&options); err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  inputs := []rule.ProjectInput{{
    Kind: rule.ProjectInputFile,
    Pattern: options.OpenAPI,
  }}
  for _, pattern := range options.Markdown {
    inputs = append(inputs, rule.ProjectInput{
      Kind: rule.ProjectInputGlob,
      Pattern: pattern,
    })
  }
  return inputs
}
```

Relative patterns are anchored to `ctx.Identity.PhysicalProjectRoot`. Exact files remain dependencies while missing, and globs remain populations while they match nothing, so later create, rename, and repair events are observable. The host normalizes symlink aliases and shares duplicate declarations before publishing one snapshot. Declare configured topology rather than only files a successful `Check` happened to read; `ProjectInputs` runs after options and project identity are resolved but before a TypeScript Program is loaded. HTTP(S) URLs are not filesystem inputs and require a contributor-owned polling or conditional-revalidation policy.

Use `ctx.SetState(value)` when a later file rule needs the exact project binding selected during that check. The host returns the same value without interpreting or serializing it:

```go
type projectBinding struct { /* contributor-owned fields */ }

func (projectGuard) Check(ctx *rule.ProjectContext) {
  ctx.SetState(loadProjectBinding(ctx.Identity))
}

func (guardedFileRule) Check(ctx *rule.Context, node *ast.Node) {
  result := ctx.ProjectResult("demo/project-guard")
  if result.Status != rule.ProjectRulePassed {
    return
  }
  binding, ok := result.State.(*projectBinding)
  if !ok {
    return
  }
  if err := binding.Revalidate(); err != nil {
    result.Report(err.Error())
    return
  }
  useGuardedResource(binding, node)
}
```

`ProjectResult` is a snapshot of the current status and findings, while its `Report` and `Fail` methods remain live until file dispatch finishes. Call `ctx.ProjectResult(name)` again to observe a failure reported by an earlier helper. Equal messages are deduplicated, distinct messages are sorted, and finalized project findings stay ahead of file findings. `absent`, `off`, and `not_evaluated` results expose no state and their mutation methods do nothing.

State belongs to one loaded Program cycle. The host does not carry it into a watch or LSP rebuild: the new project check attaches that cycle's value and receives a new reporter. A reporter retained past file dispatch is inert. The host synchronizes status changes and finding deduplication across concurrent files. The contributor must create any required fresh state and synchronize mutable data inside its own value.

Project rules use the normal `rules` map and `extends` order, but only global config entries may configure them. Any entry that contains `files`, including `files: []` or an `off` value, is rejected. Global `ignores` remain source-file filters rather than project-rule selectors. A later bare severity preserves the last explicit tuple options while replacing severity.

CLI, API, watch, and LSP runs carry the same project identity into the native host. Structured API findings use `file: null`. LSP publishes project findings once at the logical config URI with a zero range and no document version; project findings never provide fixes or code actions.

## References

<!--
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS, adding a new upstream reference.

When you add a new rule family to [Rules](#rules), do all of:

1. Append one bullet to the list immediately below. Shape:
       - [\`<upstream-package>\`](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>)
   Use the npm package name in backticks. Drop the leading `eslint-plugin-` only
   when the rule family namespace itself drops it (e.g. `@next/eslint-plugin-next`,
   `@vitest/eslint-plugin`).
2. If the family namespace inside `@ttsc/lint` (`react/*`, `jest/*`, …) is a port of
   that single upstream, mention the namespace in `### Claim ownership` so the
   maintainers know the port belongs to their family. The paragraph already lists
   `react/*, jest/*, playwright/*, tanstack-query/*, promise/*, and the other family
   namespaces`, extend that list naturally; do not start a new sentence per family.
3. Do NOT put license parentheticals (`(MIT)`, `(BSD-3-Clause)`, etc.) after the
   link. Reader clicks through if they need the license.
4. Order is roughly the same as the family ordering in [Rules](#rules); insert at
   the matching position rather than appending blindly at the end.

`@ttsc/lint` ports the rule semantics from each of the following upstream projects. Each family in [Rules](#rules) cites its origin under a `Source:` line; this section is the consolidated index.

### Claim ownership

To the maintainers of every plugin listed above: the rule semantics under `react/*`, `jest/*`, `playwright/*`, `tanstack-query/*`, `promise/*`, and the other family namespaces inside `@ttsc/lint` are a Go re-implementation of your work for the TypeScript-Go Checker. The intent is convenience, projects on `ttsc` get your rules without standing up a separate ESLint process, not ownership.

If you would prefer to publish a first-party `@ttsc/lint` plugin for your family yourself, you are welcome to take the Go sources under [`packages/lint/linthost/rules_*.go`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/tree/master/packages/lint/linthost) and the fixtures under [`tests/test-lint/src/cases/`](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/tree/master/tests/test-lint/src/cases) and ship them as your own contributor plugin. Open an issue at [samchon/ttsc](https://github.com/samchon/ttsc/issues) when the upstream package is ready, and I will retire the in-tree port and add a redirect line under [Rules](#rules) pointing at your package. Same offer for partial coverage. Name a subset and I will remove just those rules.

The contributor-plugin walkthrough is the [`@ttsc/lint` development guide](https://ttsc.dev/docs/development/walkthroughs/lint).
