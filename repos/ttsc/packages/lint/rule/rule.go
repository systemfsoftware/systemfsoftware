// Package rule is the public API for `@ttsc/lint` rule contributors.
//
// Third-party lint rule packages ("contributors") import this package and
// register their rules in an `init()`. At build time, ttsc copies a
// contributor's Go source into a sub-package of the `@ttsc/lint` Go module
// and synthesizes a blank-import in the host binary, which triggers the
// contributor's `init()` and populates the registry below.
//
// The host (`@ttsc/lint`) walks this registry during engine bootstrap and
// adapts each contributor rule onto the same dispatch table that drives
// the built-in rules.
//
// Contributors operate on the same shim AST the host and linked transform
// plugins use (`github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/shim/ast` and friends)
// — there is no facade layer in between. The shim packages are the
// publicly maintained boundary ttsc already exposes; adding another
// wrapper here would duplicate that maintenance burden without earning
// any extra stability. Contributors get the full AST surface the host
// has, so authoring a contributor rule and authoring a built-in rule are
// the same exercise.
//
// Example contributor:
//
//  package myrules
//
//  import (
//      shimast "github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/shim/ast"
//      "github.com/samchon/ttsc/packages/lint/rule"
//  )
//
//  func init() { rule.Register(noTodoComment{}) }
//
//  type noTodoComment struct{}
//
//  func (noTodoComment) Name() string             { return "demo/no-todo-comment" }
//  func (noTodoComment) Visits() []shimast.Kind   { return []shimast.Kind{shimast.KindSourceFile} }
//  func (noTodoComment) Check(ctx *rule.Context, node *shimast.Node) {
//      // ctx.File, ctx.Checker, ctx.Severity available; ctx.Report(node, msg)
//      // or ctx.ReportRange(pos, end, msg) push a finding through the engine.

//
// Application policy: a rule may emit several `TextEdit`s in one
// `ReportFix` / `ReportRangeFix` call, in any order. The unit the host
// resolves conflicts on is the FINDING, not the individual edit. Within one
// fix pass the host considers each finding's edits as one group, earliest
// group first, and accepts a group only when every member coexists with the
// edits already accepted. If any member would be dropped, the whole group is
// skipped, so a multi-edit fix never half-applies. The skipped finding is not
// lost: the next cascade pass re-runs the rule against the rewritten source
// and the fix applies then, or the cascade converges without it.
//
// A finding's own edits must therefore not overlap each other either, or the
// finding can never apply. Exact duplicates within one finding are collapsed
// rather than treated as a conflict, so repeating an identical edit is
// harmless. Nothing diagnoses a skipped group, and the host does not report
// when a comment falls inside a deletion range.
