// TestLSPHintsAbsenceIsNotAnError pins that a plugin without the hint verb is
// silent, not broken.
//
// Every plugin built before this channel existed rejects `lsp-hints` as an
// unknown command, and that is permanent and universal rather than a
// transitional state. Treating it as a discovery failure would print an error
// per plugin per editor session, forever, for a feature those plugins were never
// asked to provide. It is the optional-interface reasoning applied to the wire:
// absence is an answer.
//
// A real sidecar that cannot run reaches the same path as one that rejects the
// verb — both return an error from run — so an unresolvable binary is a faithful
// stand-in and keeps the test from needing a compiled fixture.
//
//  1. Discover hints from a plugin whose sidecar cannot answer.
//  2. Assert the corpus is empty.
//  3. Assert nothing was written to the log.
