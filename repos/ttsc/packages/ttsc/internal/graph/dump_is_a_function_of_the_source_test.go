// TestDumpIsAFunctionOfTheSource pins the graph to the code it describes: two
// builds of one unedited snapshot must produce one byte-identical document.
//
// It did not. A private class member — `#count` — is bound under a mangled name
// carrying a counter that advances as the program is bound: `__#41@#count` in one
// run, `__#38@#count` in the next. That counter reached the node id, and with it
// the wire. On VS Code, 661 nodes and 661 edges changed identity between two
// dumps of the *same source*: a handle the model was given could name nothing
// after a restart, and no dump could be compared with another to prove that a
// change had left the facts alone — the byte test every graph optimisation is
// supposed to answer to was itself meaningless.
//
// Two classes each declare a `#count`, so the mangling counter is exercised more
// than once and a per-class collision would surface here rather than in a
// three-million-line repository.
