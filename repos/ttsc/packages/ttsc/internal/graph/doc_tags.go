// DocTag is one documentation tag TypeScript itself does not recognize, written
// on a workspace declaration and captured verbatim.
//
// A convention attaches a declaration to something outside the type system — a
// specification section, an API operation, a reference document — and writes
// that attachment as a tag. `@evidence docs/pricing.md#sale`, `@reference
// https://…`, and a consumer's own `@spec` are the same fact in three
// spellings, and none of them is expressible as an edge because the thing on
// the other end is not a TypeScript declaration.
//
// The population is defined by the compiler rather than by us: these are the
// tags the parser had no meaning for, so it kept them as
// KindJSDocUnknownTag. A known tag — `@param`, `@returns`, `@deprecated` — has
// its own AST shape and its own meaning and is not this. Naming particular tags
// here would make the compiler host know one convention, and would have left
// out the 767 `@reference` tags this repository's own sources carry.
//
// Nothing is interpreted. Target is not split out of Text, because which part
// of a tag's text names a thing is a convention's rule and this pass enforces
// none; a consumer that ranks on a leading token does so in the layer that
// declares its selection heuristic. This is the contract Decorator already
// keeps for `@Controller`/`@Get`.
type DocTag struct {
  // Target is the id of the graph node the tag was written on.
  Target string
  // Name is the tag name without its `@` (`evidence`, `evidenceExclude`,
  // `reference`).
  Name string
  // Text is everything after the tag name, with the comment's leading asterisks
  // and per-line indentation removed and its lines joined by single spaces.
  // Empty when the tag carries no text.
  Text string
  // Pos and End bound the written tag. They are not published — a tag rides its
  // target node, which carries the span a reader cites — and exist so one
  // declaration presented to the node pass twice contributes its tags once.

// declaration form the build records — a function, a class, an interface member,
// a variable binding, a closure, a namespace member — carries its tags without
// each form having to remember to ask. A merged identity therefore accumulates
// the tags of every declaration that names it: an overload run documented on its
// signature and implemented below keeps the signature's tags, which putting this
// inside the node-creation branch would have dropped.
//
// Positions deduplicate, because the same declaration node can be presented to
// putDeclaredNode more than once and a tag is a property of where it is written.

// written on a `const` was lost. The statement is reached through its

// One statement can declare several bindings (`export const a = 1, b = 2`), and
