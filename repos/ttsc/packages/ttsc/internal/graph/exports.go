// markExports records a module's export surface: a node for the module itself
// and an `exports` edge to every declaration its export table resolves to. It
// runs on the checker, so it sees the real public surface — an inline
// `export class`, a separate `export { Foo }`, a re-export
// `export { Foo } from "./foo"`, and a barrel `export *` all land here, where a
// purely syntactic `export`-modifier scan would miss the re-export forms that
// carry most of a monorepo's public API. Each resolved node is also flagged
// Exported.
//
// The edge is what the flag cannot say. A package's front door and its legacy
// subpath both re-export, so both surfaces end up Exported and a ranker that
// reads the flag alone cannot tell zod's `.` entry from its `./v3` one: it picks
// whichever name matches the query best, which is how a tour of the current API
// came back centered on the legacy implementation. The edge keeps the module the
// symbol came out of, so a caller holding a package.json — which names its entry
// file and nothing else — can ask the graph what that file, and only that file,
// puts on the wire.
//
// A barrel declares nothing of its own, so without a module node it is absent
// from the graph entirely: the file a package.json points at, the one thing that
// answers "what is this package's public API", is the one file the index never
// had. The module node is that anchor, and the export edges hang from it.
