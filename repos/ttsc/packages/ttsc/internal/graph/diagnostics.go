// FileDiagnostics returns the resident program's compiler diagnostics for the
// source file at path, with the code tsgo reports and the location the driver
// resolves (see Diagnostic: authored-relative under a source preamble). Because
// the graph rides the already-open Program, this is one Program.Diagnostics()
// call over the warm checker, not a second compile.
//
// This is the compiler-only slice: it carries the TypeScript semantic
// diagnostics, not @ttsc/lint or transform-plugin findings.
//
// This is the per-file view. The dump publishes the whole-program view through
// NewDiagnostics, which groups and relativizes the same driver.Diagnostic values
// in one pass; prefer it when every file is wanted, because filtering per file
// here rescans the program's diagnostics once per call.
