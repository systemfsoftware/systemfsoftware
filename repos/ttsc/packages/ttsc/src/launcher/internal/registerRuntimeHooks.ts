/**
 * Bootstrap `ttsx` spawns as the child's main module: it installs the runtime
 * module hooks, then loads the TypeScript entry _from source_.
 *
 * Why load the entry here instead of passing it as Node's main entry: a
 * CommonJS `require("./x")` chain only reaches `module.registerHooks` when the
 * entry itself is loaded through a CommonJS `require`. Running the `.ts` as
 * Node's ESM-first main entry leaves inner `require`s on the native loader,
 * where they cannot resolve a sibling `.ts`. So the parent invokes `node
 * registerRuntimeHooks.js <entry> [argv...]` and we `require()` (or dynamically
 * `import()`) the entry after the hooks are live.
 *
 * `process.argv` is rewritten to `[node, <entry>, ...argv]` so the program sees
 * the same argv it would under a direct `node <entry>` invocation.
