 * arrives through plain `fs.realpathSync`, which resolves reparse points but
 * leaves a Windows 8.3 component alone, while the entry arrives through
 * `fs.realpathSync.native`, which expands it — and `path.relative` folds case
 * but not 8.3. A declared `rootDir` is worse still: it is joined verbatim, so a
 * `rootDir` that is itself a symlinked directory never resolves at all. Either
 * way the gate reads an in-project entry as outside its own root, pays a second
 * whole build for it, and publishes a wider root than the project has.
 *
 * The pass costs nothing in agreement with the root tsgo was pinned to, which
 * stays unresolved on purpose so it matches the spelling tsgo gives the input
 * file names it compares against it. Only the prefix differs between the two;
 * each side strips its own, so the relative path below the root — the part that

 * an _entry_: it needs that same project's compiler options, not its file list.
 * Those two requirements are not in conflict, but the whole-project build
 * cannot satisfy the second one, so an entry it did not emit is compiled here
 * through a project that inherits every option and declares only the entry.
 *
 * The synthesized tsconfig is written beside the real one on purpose. `extends`

 * any other location silently retargets them. It is removed as soon as the

 * the entry — for the layout this exists for, the project root itself; for an
 * entry that is a symlink out of the tree, the ancestor the two trees share. It
 * has to widen at least that far, because the inherited `rootDir` (`src`) does
 * not contain the entry and tsgo emits an input outside `rootDir` to its own
 * source path.
 *
 * Widening costs precision, not safety. The manifest's `rootDir` bounds which
 * files the runtime hooks will try to serve from this emit, so a wide one
 * admits more sources to the lookup — but the lookup only ever answers with a
 * file from this build's own emit directory, whether from `emittedFiles` or a
 * scan of `outDir` (`resolveEmittedJavaScript`). What a wide root risks is the
 * exact mirror missing and the trailing-stem matcher picking the wrong output
