 * any ancestor could be the source, and a watch session, which reprints the
 * same line on every save. Every ttsc-owned configuration read goes through
 * these helpers so the failure names its file and position in ttsc's own
 * diagnostic voice, like the neighbouring `ttsc: extended tsconfig not found:
 * …`.
 *
 * Comment, trailing-comma, and BOM removal is length-preserving (each removed
 * character becomes a space, each removed newline stays a newline), so the line
 * and column the JSON parser reports are the position in the file the user
 * actually edited rather than in a shortened intermediate string.
