 * A pair of temporary files standing in for a child process's pipes.

 * keep more than `maxBuffer` bytes, so any piped capture has to name a ceiling
 * — and a ceiling is a number nobody chose for this machine, deciding on the
 * user's behalf that a large but legitimate build said too much. Handing the
 * child a file descriptor instead means the bytes never pass through this heap
 * on their way out of the child: how much a process may write is the
 * filesystem's business, and that is the same answer on every machine. Reading
 * the result back still materializes a string, so V8's own maximum string
 * length remains the outer bound — but that is a property of the runtime rather
 * than a budget chosen here, and it is identical everywhere this runs.
 *
 * The directory is per-call, so two concurrent spawns cannot read each other's
 * bytes.
