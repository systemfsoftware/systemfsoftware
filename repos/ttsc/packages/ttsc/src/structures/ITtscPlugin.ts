/**
 * Runtime descriptor returned by a ttsc plugin module.

 * point. After ttsc resolves that JavaScript module, the module must return an
 * `ITtscPlugin` descriptor either directly, as `default`, as `plugin`, or from
 * a descriptor factory.
 *
 * The descriptor tells ttsc which Go source package implements the native
 * behavior and where it participates in the TypeScript-Go pipeline. ttsc then
 * builds the Go source lazily with the bundled Go toolchain and passes the
 * original project plugin config through `--plugins-json`.

   * Go package directory, or a `go.mod` file, that ttsc lazily builds.
   *
   * Ttsc accepts source only. It does not accept a prebuilt binary path: the
   * package-local Go compiler builds this source into the ttsc plugin cache on
   * demand.
   *
   * Directory sources search upward at most 3 parent directories for `go.mod`;
   * direct `go.mod` sources build the module root as `.`. A `package main`
   * source builds as an executable sidecar; a non-`main` transform source is
   * linked into the selected native host and must register through

   * descriptors published in npm packages should normally return absolute paths
   * based on their own descriptor directory — derive them from a factory's
   * `context.dirname` (the load-mode-independent replacement for `__dirname`,
   * which is undefined when ttsc loads the descriptor through ttsx or as ESM).
   *
   * Common layouts:
   *
   * - `source: path.resolve(context.dirname, "src")` when a package descriptor
   *   keeps its Go command in `src`.
   * - `source: path.resolve(context.dirname, "plugin")` when a published package
   *   has a dedicated Go plugin folder.
   * - `source: "plugin"` only for project-local descriptors where the consumer
   *   project root owns the `plugin` directory.
   * - `source: "go.mod"` when the consumer project root itself is the command
   *   package; use an absolute `go.mod` path for npm package descriptors.

  /**

   * blank import. The contributor's `init()` runs before the host binary's

   *
   * Differs from `composes`:
   *
   * - `composes` is horizontal — many plugin entries dispatch to one binary by

   *   with its own lifecycle slot.
   * - `contributors` is vertical — one binary statically links additional Go
   *   sources that never appear as top-level plugin entries. The contributing
   *   npm packages are discovered through the host plugin's own config file
   *   (e.g. `lint.config.ts` for `@ttsc/lint`).
   *
   * Constraints:
   *
   * - Contributors ship Go source as a package (no `go.mod`); the host plugin's
   *   module supplies every transitive Go dependency. This is also a
   *   supply-chain feature — contributors cannot pull in arbitrary Go modules
   *   at build time.
   * - Contributor source paths must be absolute (the host plugin's JS factory
   *   typically resolves them through `require.resolve`).
   * - Contributor names are used as the sub-package import suffix and must be
   *   unique within a single plugin build.
