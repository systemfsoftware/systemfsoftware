 * Resident, incremental transform service for the `ttsc` TypeScript-Go
 * pipeline.
 *
 * Where {@link TtscCompiler.transform} spawns a fresh process and recompiles the
 * whole project on every call, `TtscService` keeps one long-lived host warm: it
 * compiles the project once and then answers per-file transform requests from
 * that warm program. A single service instance transforms many files (a watch
 * server, an editor session, a codegen tool) while paying the project compile
 * once instead of once per file. Sharing one host across separate worker
 * processes (a Metro worker pool) is tracked in samchon/ttsc#255.
 *
 * The shape mirrors a legacy TypeScript `LanguageService`: construct it against
 * a project context, ask it to transform individual files, and dispose it when
 * done. Construction is synchronous (it launches the host); the host compiles
 * in the background, so the first {@link transformFile} resolves once that
 * compile lands.
 *
 * Resident mode runs through the linked-plugin shared host, so the project must
 * declare at least one transform-stage plugin; the constructor throws
 * otherwise. It does not run check-stage plugins (unlike
 * {@link TtscCompiler.transform}); only the program's own type-checking gates an
 * {@link updateFile}.
