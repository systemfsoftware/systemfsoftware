// Every measured green CI run finished the package in 0.44s-0.93s, so the
// budget is a ~130x margin that only a wedged runtime can reach. It has to sit
// well below `go test`'s own kill, because that kill produces no evidence
// here: the -exec wrapper is node, so the SIGQUIT lands on node and dumps a
// node process, never the Go goroutines running inside the wasm module.

// TestMain arms a teardown guard that outlives the tests themselves.
//
// Three CI runs -- 30661299811 on feat/incremental-graph-snapshots,
// 30970615435 on feat/evidence-package, and 31080957168 on
// campaign/evidence-luna-0.24.0 -- ended identically: every test passed, the
// binary wrote "PASS", and then the process never exited until `go test`
// killed it at 11m0s, 662s into a package that otherwise takes under a second.
// testing's own -test.timeout alarm never fired, which places the stall after
// M.Run stopped that alarm: in the epilogue that writes "PASS" and calls
// os.Exit, where a js/wasm stdout write reaches node but its completion event
// is never delivered back into the Go runtime.
//
// Nothing inside the process can recover from that unaided. host.Expose, which
// this suite starts to obtain the JS API, deliberately keeps a perpetual
// hourly keepalive goroutine alive for the rest of the binary, so node's event
// loop always holds a pending timer. wasm_exec_node.js only rescues a stalled
// program from its process "exit" hook, which fires when the loop drains --
// so the hook that would otherwise force Go to print every goroutine stack can
// never run here.
//
// The guard is therefore never stopped: the stall it exists for happens after
// the last test, so a timer scoped to the tests would already be disarmed by
// the time it mattered. On a healthy run the process exits in under a second
// and the pending timer is simply discarded with it.
