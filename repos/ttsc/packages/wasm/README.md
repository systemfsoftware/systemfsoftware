# @ttsc/wasm

> **API stability: experimental until v1.0.** Public signatures (`Plugin.Run`, the `host.Expose` argv shape, the JS `ITtscApi` surface, the linker-symbol contract below) may change between minor releases. Pin exact versions in production playgrounds.

In-browser ttsc playground scaffolding. Compose ttsc + typescript-go with your own plugins by writing a single Go entry that calls `host.Expose(...)`, then boot it from JS with `bootTtsc(...)`.

## What you get

- A base `ttsc.wasm` (under `dist/`) that exposes vanilla `build` / `check` / `transform`, no plugins linked. Useful as a sanity test or a no-plugin baseline.
- A Go helper package (`host/`) plugin authors import from their own `main_wasm.go` to bind a wasm to `globalThis[yourApiName]`.
- A JS runtime (`bootTtsc`, `createMemFS`, typed `ITtscApi` surface) that loads any host-built wasm into a Web Worker.

The package is plugin-agnostic. Downstream playgrounds (the ttsc.dev website, typia, anything else) build their own wasm against the same `host/` package.

## Build your own playground in 30 lines

1. Add the dependency:

```bash
npm install -D @ttsc/wasm
```

2. Create `your-pkg/cmd/your-wasm/main_wasm.go`:

```go
//go:build js && wasm

package main

import (
  "github.com/samchon/ttsc/packages/wasm/host"
  yourplugin "example.com/your/plugin"
)

func main() {
  host.Expose("yourApi", host.Config{
    Plugins: []host.Plugin{yourplugin.New()},
  })
}
```

The native sibling `main.go` is recommended when you want `go run ./cmd/your-wasm` to smoke-test the same `host.Plugin` dispatchers without the browser MemFS bridge. See `packages/wasm/cmd/ttsc-wasm/main.go` and `website/compiler/cmd/playground/main.go` in the repo for reference layouts. A minimal custom plugin dispatcher looks like this:

```go
//go:build !js

package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/samchon/ttsc/packages/wasm/host"
  yourplugin "example.com/your/plugin"
)

func main() {
  plugins := []host.Plugin{yourplugin.New()}
  if len(os.Args) >= 3 {
    name, command := os.Args[1], os.Args[2]
    for _, p := range plugins {
      if p.Name() == name {
        result := host.InvokePlugin(context.Background(), p, command, os.Args[3:])
        fmt.Fprint(os.Stdout, result.Stdout)
        fmt.Fprint(os.Stderr, result.Stderr)
        os.Exit(result.Code)
      }
    }
  }
  fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "usage: your-wasm <plugin> <command> [args...]")
  os.Exit(2)
}
```

3. Build the wasm:

```bash
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" \
  -o public/your.wasm ./cmd/your-wasm
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" public/wasm_exec.js
```

Keep `wasm_exec.js` from the same Go toolchain that built your wasm. The prebuilt `dist/ttsc.wasm` and `dist/wasm_exec.js` pair already match each other; custom binaries should copy the loader from their own toolchain. Older Go installs may keep the loader under `$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js` instead of `lib/wasm`.

### Stamping version metadata at link time

The `host` package exposes a build-time variable contract you can override via `-ldflags "-X ..."`:

```bash
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -trimpath \
  -ldflags "-s -w -X github.com/samchon/ttsc/packages/wasm/host.version=$(cat package.json | jq -r .version)" \
  -o public/your.wasm ./cmd/your-wasm
```

The `version`, `commit`, and `date` variables in `host/host.go` are all overridable. `globalThis[apiName].version()` reads from them.

4. Boot it from JS (a Web Worker is **required**: Go's `syscall/js` blocks the runtime while the wasm is alive; running on the main thread freezes the page). Use a classic Worker or a bundler target that still exposes `importScripts`; `bootTtsc` imports `wasm_exec.js` before starting Go.

```ts
import { bootTtsc } from "@ttsc/wasm";

const controller = new AbortController();
const { api, host } = await bootTtsc({
  wasmUrl: "/your.wasm",
  apiName: "yourApi",
  signal: controller.signal,
});

host.writeFile("/work/tsconfig.json", '{"compilerOptions":{"strict":true}}');
host.writeFile("/work/src/index.ts", "export const x: number = 1;");

const result = await api.build({ cwd: "/work" });
console.log(result.result); // JSON: { diagnostics, output }
```

There is no boot deadline. How long a fetch and instantiation take belongs to the network and the machine, not to a number chosen here, and a boot cancelled on that number is a failure the page cannot retry into success. A caller abort cancels the shared in-flight boot; aborting any caller that joined the same boot cancels that shared attempt. Failures before `go.run` clear cache and callback state so a later call can retry. `importScripts` is synchronous, so cancellation is observed immediately before and after that call but cannot interrupt the script while it evaluates.

Once `go.run` starts, JavaScript cannot terminate the Go wasm runtime. A boot failure from that point throws `BootTtscWorkerTerminationError` with code `TTSC_WASM_WORKER_TERMINATION_REQUIRED`, and later boots for the same `apiName` reject without installing another readiness bridge. Terminate and replace that Worker before retrying.

Booting two wasms with the same `apiName` overwrites the previous global binding; pick a unique `apiName` per binary. `bootTtsc` also installs shared `fs` and `process` globals in its Worker, so use separate Workers when binaries need independent filesystems.

## Fountain API (snapshot, AST, type checker)

For embedders that want `embed-typescript`-style raw access to the program, diagnostics, AST nodes, the type checker at a position. The same `globalThis[apiName]` object also exposes fountain verbs. They share the standard `{code, stdout, stderr, result}` envelope; `result` is JSON.

```ts
import { bootTtsc, parseResult } from "@ttsc/wasm";
import type {
  ITtscSnapshotResult,
  ITtscTypeAtPositionResult,
} from "@ttsc/wasm";

const { api, host } = await bootTtsc({ wasmUrl, apiName });

host.writeFile("/work/tsconfig.json", "{}");
host.writeFile("/work/src/index.ts", "export const x: number = 1;");

const snap = parseResult<ITtscSnapshotResult>(
  await api.snapshot({ cwd: "/work" }),
);
const handle = snap!.handle;

try {
  const typeAt = parseResult<ITtscTypeAtPositionResult>(
    await api.getTypeAtPosition({
      handle,
      path: "src/index.ts",
      position: 13, // byte offset of `x`
    }),
  );
  console.log(typeAt?.type?.text); // → "number"
} finally {
  await api.releaseSnapshot({ handle });
}
```

Verbs and payload types:

| Verb | Payload type |
| --- | --- |
| `snapshot({ cwd, tsconfig? })` | `ITtscSnapshotResult` `{ handle }` |
| `releaseSnapshot({ handle })` | `ITtscReleaseSnapshotResult` `{ released }` |
| `snapshots()` | `ITtscSnapshotsResult` `{ handles }` |
| `getSourceFiles({ handle })` | `ITtscSourceFilesResult` `{ files }` |
| `getSourceFileText({ handle, path })` | `ITtscSourceFileTextResult` `{ text }` |
| `getDiagnostics({ handle, file? })` | `ITtscFountainDiagnosticsResult` `{ diagnostics }` |
| `getNodeAtPosition({ handle, path, position })` | `ITtscNodeAtPositionResult` `{ node }` |
| `getTypeAtPosition({ handle, path, position })` | `ITtscTypeAtPositionResult` `{ type }` |
| `getSymbolAtPosition({ handle, path, position })` | `ITtscSymbolAtPositionResult` `{ symbol }` |

`getNodeAtPosition` returns the syntax token touching `position`, including punctuation. `getTypeAtPosition` resolves that token to its enclosing semantic AST node, while `getSymbolAtPosition` queries the token directly. Both return `null` when there is no semantic answer. Whitespace and comments return `null` for all three verbs.

`position` is a **byte offset** into the source text and must satisfy `0 <= position < UTF-8 byte length of sourceText`. The same coordinate TypeScript-Go uses internally. JS callers that have a UTF-16 `(line, character)` pair (e.g. From Monaco) must convert it before calling.

**Lifecycle:** JS owns the handle. The wasm keeps the program (parsed AST, checker pool lease, every source file) alive until you call `releaseSnapshot`. Leaking handles leaks memory in the wasm linear heap.

## Plugin contract

`host.Plugin` matches ttsc's existing CLI sidecar dispatch:

```go
type Plugin interface {
  Name() string
  Run(invocation *PluginInvocation) int
}
```

The host installs `globalThis[apiName].plugin({ name, command, ...opts })` that translates the JS options object into `invocation.Command` and CLI-shaped `invocation.Args`. Write output to `invocation.Stdout` and `invocation.Stderr`. Utility-backed plugins can call `utility.RunBuildWithIO(invocation.Args, invocation.Stdout, invocation.Stderr)` so the native command and browser adapter share implementation without replacing process-global streams.

Use `invocation.Go` for asynchronous work that belongs to the result. Register it before `Run` returns; the host waits for registered work, closes registration when `Run` returns, and rejects later writes to the invocation streams.

## Published-tarball Go module layout

The published `@ttsc/wasm` tarball ships:

- A rewritten root `go.mod` whose `replace` directives point at `./shim-vendor/shim/*` (vendored at pack time from `packages/ttsc/shim/`).
- The full `host/`, `cmd/`, `build/` Go source so consumers can `go build -tags '...'` their own wasm against your host helper.
- `dist/ttsc.wasm` + `dist/wasm_exec.js`: the no-plugin sanity binary and the Go runtime loader.

The tarball intentionally drops the `replace github.com/samchon/ttsc/packages/ttsc => ../ttsc` directive that the in-repo `go.mod` carries: consumers of the published module who want to rebuild the wasm must supply their own `replace` (or vendor `packages/ttsc` themselves). The published `dist/ttsc.wasm` is plug-and-play for runtime use; the Go module is for **plugin authors extending the host**, not for vanilla consumers.

## Documents

- The base wasm (`dist/ttsc.wasm`) is the binary `cmd/ttsc-wasm/main_wasm.go` produces. Look there for a minimal example.
