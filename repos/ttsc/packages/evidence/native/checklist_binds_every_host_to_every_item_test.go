 *
 * The option is confined to the Markdown reference, never to the claim, and the case it was asked for is a document set answering a rules document. A claim-kind dependency would leave that shape working only for code, and the file-level host is the granularity that makes the document side usable at all.
 *
 *  1. Select whole plan documents as hosts and a two-item rules document as the checklist.
 *  2. Answer both items in one plan and nothing in the other.
 *  3. Assert the answering plan passes and the silent plan owes both items.
