// no coverage, no cardinality, no policy, no diagnostic crosses this boundary.
// Those are this rule's product and it already delivers them as compile errors;
// a consumer holding a second copy would hold an unmaintained one.
//
// Only selected units are published, which is what makes a document nobody
// configured a reference for contribute nothing, and what withdraws a unit that
// named the tag it hid itself behind: selection is where the rule's own answer
// about its surface already lives, so this asks it rather than repeating it.
//
// TypeScript units are not published. The graph already holds every TypeScript
// declaration as a real node resolved by the checker, and a second node for the
// same symbol under an evidence address would make one declaration two things.
