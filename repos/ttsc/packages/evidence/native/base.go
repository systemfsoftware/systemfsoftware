// populationBase is the directory one rooted artifact population resolves
// against.
//
// Every population had exactly one base before `root` existed — the ttsc
// project root — and that is still the default. Declaring a root moves three
// things together, and keeping them together is what makes the escape coherent:
// the globs resolve against it, a unit's target is spelled relative to it, and a
// diagnostic names the file through it. A requirements set shared by two
// packages therefore answers to the *same* citation text in both, which is the
// only reason a second project can adopt a document set the first already cites.
//
// The alternative — project-relative targets that ascend with `../` — was
// rejected because it re-couples the citation to the citing project's position
// in the tree, so the same document owns a different address in every package
// that reads it. This mirrors what a `package` TypeScript reference already
// does: moving the base moves the address space with it (`graph.go`,
// `materializePackageGlobReference`).

  // judged the same base by.

  // Display is what a diagnostic names: project-relative, ascending with `..`
  // when the base sits above the project, and absolute only when no relative
  // spelling exists. Empty for the default base, whose files are already named
  // by their project-relative path.
  Display string
  // Default marks the base a population takes when it declares no root. Its
  // addresses stay plain project-relative paths, which is what leaves every
  // existing citation, unit identity, and diagnostic byte-identical.
