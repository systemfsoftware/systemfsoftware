// scopeIndex answers what a citation of one unit has to name, over one
// reference's whole materialized population.
//
// The scope of a citation is the unit plus every structural descendant, and it is
// deliberately **not** the reference's covered set. `UnitsByScope` and `Units` are
// both narrowed by that reference's `symbol` selector, while one `@evidence` tag
// may acknowledge several references and carries exactly one fingerprint token.
// Composing from a narrowed set made the value a function of the reference: a
// selector that skipped the descendants left them out of the digest, so the
// review never expired, and two references over one scope under different
// selectors demanded two different values from that single token with no value
// able to satisfy both. The population is passed instead, which is why this type
// exists rather than a function over `Units`.
//
// So the fingerprint is a property of the address a citation names rather than of
// what the citation discharges. A reference confining acknowledgement to the
// named unit does not narrow this: the citation still names the scope, and
// re-reviewing when the subtree moves is conservative rather than wrong.
//
// Descendants are found through the stored parent identity, never through a
// shared address prefix. A literal dot may sit inside a TypeScript name, so
// treating a common prefix as ownership would make an unrelated same-name
// declaration an ancestor.
//
// A withdrawn descendant contributes its identity, so adding `@internal` to a
// member moves the composite: the tag's own block is excluded as a tag position,
// which would otherwise make a withdrawal invisible.
//
// Its content is **not** separable from its ancestor's, and an earlier version of
// this comment claimed otherwise. A TypeScript unit's digest is its whole
// declaration text, so a withdrawn member's body is already inside the enclosing
// type's digest and no substitution here can take it out. Churn behind
// `@internal` therefore does expire a review of the enclosing type. That is
// conservative noise rather than a wrong answer, and the honest trade: removing it
// means excluding every child unit's span from its ancestor's text, which is a
// second exclusion mechanism layered on the tag-position one.
//
// The index is built once per reference and the answers are memoized, because
// building it per citation is quadratic and the cost is not theoretical: it spans
// the whole population, so a claim with a citation per selected unit would walk
// every unit once per citation. On a requirements set of a few thousand headings
// that is millions of map inserts per Program cycle, paid again on every watch
// rebuild, for a value that is identical each time.

// tag can occupy". Removing only the block that happens to carry a tag would
// leave the case that breaks first: a property's own JSDoc is interior text of
// the interface containing it, so writing a review on one property would change
// the digest of every citation of the enclosing type.
//
// Blocks are collected from the whole subtree rather than from the declaration
// alone, for that same reason. An ordinary comment interior to the declaration
// stays in the digest, and that is correct: the graph reads tags only from the
// blocks a node reports, so no citation can hide in one.
//
// Leading text is the other case and reaches the digest in some forms only.
// Text outside the declaration's span was never in it, which for a variable is
// everything above its declarator, including the `export const` and any comment
// above a sibling. Text a full start swallowed is inside the span, and there
// `withoutLeadingTrivia` drops the blank lines and `//` comments while a
// documentation block is cut as a tag position. A block comment that is neither
// is hashed, so editing an ordinary `/* */` above an undocumented declaration
// expires a review of it.
