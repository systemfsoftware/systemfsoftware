 * runs, so `aliased: Handler` stays a property even though `Handler` is spelled
 * `() => void` two lines above it.
 *
 * The two containers are asserted together because they share one collector,
 * and a case for one would leave the other free to drift.
 *
 *  1. Spell a function-typed member, an alias-typed member, a method signature,
 *     an overload run, and a data member on both containers.
 *  2. Collect the inventory.
 *  3. Assert both answer identically, and that only the alias and the data

 * materializes everything", and the abstract function-typed member crosses the
