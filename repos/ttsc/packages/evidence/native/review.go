// reviewRule requires a verification statement beside every citation.
//
// `evidence/graph` proves that a target resolves, that its host is eligible, and
// that every selected unit is acknowledged. All three are properties of the
// graph as it stands, so none of them records that anyone read the cited unit
// and compared it against the citing declaration. An author writes one prose
// reason answering why this declaration answers for that target, and is never
// asked what they actually checked. Those are different questions, and a
// fabricated citation clears the second one as easily as the first because the
// second one is never put.
//
// The rule puts it. Every `@evidence` and `@evidenceExclude` on a public
// identity must be answered by an `@evidenceReview` naming the same target, so a
// citation cannot be produced without a separately addressed statement written
// as its own act.
//
// What it does not do is judge whether that statement is sincere. The project's
// own rule forbids it: a rule guessing at prose teaches authors to write filler
// that passes. What expires a review when the cited content moves is the
// fingerprint `evidence/graph` validates under `requireReview`; this rule
// carries the token without interpreting it, so a project can adopt the
// discipline before it adopts the expiry.
