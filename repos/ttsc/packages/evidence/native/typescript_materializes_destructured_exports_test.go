/**
 * Verifies a binding leaf stays a property when the pattern is initialized with

 *
 * The cases above destructure records and arrays of data, so the leaf rule is
 * pinned only where nothing could have made a leaf callable. A `const`
 * initialized with a function is the one shape that reaches the callable
 * branch, and the binding-pattern guard is what stops the whole pattern's
 * initializer from being attributed to each leaf.
 *
 * The two pattern kinds are not symmetric. The object row is a program that
 * compiles, since a function does carry `length` and `name`; the array row is
 * `TS2488` under a checker, because a function is not iterable. It is here
 * anyway: the guard covers both kinds, nothing else in the package narrows it,
 * and its shape is what this case is for.
 *
 *  1. Destructure a function into an object pattern and into an array pattern.
 *  2. Collect the inventory.
 *  3. Assert every leaf is a property.
