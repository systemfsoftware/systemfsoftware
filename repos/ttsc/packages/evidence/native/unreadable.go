// attachedCommentEnds indexes, by end offset, where each attached documentation

//
// The end is what identifies a comment: the parser stops reading one exactly
// where the scanner does. A block's reported start is not, because it is a full
// start, and a full start reaches back to the previous token and swallows every
// blank line and every comment between. Testing containment against that made
// the reporter answer differently depending on what followed a tag, so a
// citation in a `//` comment was reported above an undocumented declaration and
// silent above a documented one, which is the shape an author is most likely to
// write in a codebase that documents its exports.

// reportUnreadableTypeScriptTags records every tag written in a comment the

//
// The graph reads tags only from the blocks a node reports, which is what keeps
// a citation, the host it lands on, and the exclusion that must cut it out of a
// digest all naming the same position. A comment the parser attached to nothing
// is outside that agreement: no node reports it, so the tag in it reaches no
// host and is not excluded from anything either.
//
// Discarding it silently is the failure this rule exists to remove. The comment
// is real, the file keeps it, and an author reading the source sees a citation
// that does nothing while the coverage diagnostic that follows names the
// reference and suggests writing the citation they already wrote.
//
// The shapes are ordinary rather than exotic. TypeScript attaches no
// documentation to a binding element, so a block between the braces of a
// destructuring pattern is read by nobody; a `//` comment is not documentation
// at all, which is one keystroke from a block that is; and a documented
// declaration an author commented out keeps a citation that now proves nothing.

// Every run of two or more slashes comes off, so a tag buried behind a third or
// a fourth is answered like one behind two. They are unreadable for one reason
// and by one keystroke, and answering only some of them split one comment
// against itself: the review parser removes `///` and the declaration parser
// does not, so `/// @evidenceReview` was reported while the `/// @evidence`

// them in a defined order so its input does not depend on map iteration.
//
// Only a file some configured glob selects is reported. A base is a directory
// and a population is a glob inside it, so a file is scanned whenever it sits
// under a declared root and belongs to a population only if the glob takes it.
// Reporting every scanned file made the rule answer for source it does not
// govern: a stray tag in a consumer's `node_modules` failed their build, naming
// a repair in a file they did not write.
