/**
 * Verifies a claim population hears the scan problems its own files raise.
 *
 * A scan problem says the file materialized less than it looks like it should, and that is a hole on either side: a reference loses evidence units, a claim loses the hosts that owe acknowledgements. Only the reference side was told. The claim side is the one that stayed silent in the worse direction, because a whitespace-named claim file forms no target at all, so it contributes no host, leaves the obligation, and reported nothing on its way out.
 *
 *  1. Point a Markdown claim at a whitespace-named file beside an ordinary one, and assert the path is reported while the ordinary file still owes its acknowledgement.
 *  2. Make that file the claim's only one, so the claim materializes no host and deactivates, and assert it still reports.
 *  3. Assert an anchorless heading in a claim file is reported, and withheld from a claim that does not read that kind.
 *  4. Assert a file both populations read reports each problem once.
