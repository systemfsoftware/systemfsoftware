// typeScriptInventories remembers a scanned file for as long as the host keeps
// handing back the same parsed source.
//
// Scanning the Program into inventories is the single largest cost of a graph
// rebuild, and a watch cycle repeats it after every keystroke for every file —
// including the thousands the edit did not touch. The compiler already answers
// which files changed: it reuses the `*ast.SourceFile` of an unchanged file and
// produces a new one for an edited file, so the pointer is both the cheapest
// and the most exact key available. A scan can never be served for content the
// host no longer holds.
//
// This is the rule's own memory rather than host state, the same standing the
// Swagger and Prisma caches have. The mutex is there because a resident host
// may hold several projects at once.
//
// Two generations are kept. On each cycle the live generation becomes the
// previous one and a fresh live generation starts, so a lookup still hits after
// one intervening cycle while resident memory stays bounded by twice the file
// set rather than growing with the session's edit count. A resident host
// alternating between two projects pays a miss per switch; correctness does not
// depend on the hit.
