// graphCorpus is what a passing Check publishes for Hints to project.
//
// It carries the inventories Check already built rather than the paths to
// rebuild them from. The graph loads Markdown and Swagger to do its own job, so
// handing that result forward costs a build nothing; reloading inside Hints
// would read every source a second time to answer a question the rule had just
// finished answering.
//
// What the editor path does pay is Check itself. A hints request runs a fresh
// project cycle (`linthost/hints.go:74`), so every source the graph reads is
// read again there — including an HTTP(S) Swagger reference, which is fetched.
// That cost is inherent to answering from a current index rather than a stale
// one, and it is bounded the same way a build is: a source that fails to load
// is reported by Check, which fails the rule, which withdraws the corpus.

// Hints projects the configured evidence population into editor completions.

// A target has to be reproduced exactly, and the anchor an author cannot recall
// is the one this offers. The corpus is a value: the host serializes it and the
// LSP proxy answers from cache long after the lint process exited, so nothing
// here can be computed per keystroke.
//
// The corpus is available only while the graph passes, and that is a host gate
// rather than a choice made here. `linthost/hints.go:147-149` skips a rule whose
// snapshot is not `ProjectRulePassed` or whose state is nil, and
// `projectReporter.Report` sets `failed = true` unconditionally
// (`linthost/project_engine.go:68-77`). So the cycle that reports an unmet
// obligation is the cycle that withdraws the completions — which is the cycle an
// author is most likely to be writing a citation in. Nothing in this package can
// widen that; it widens upstream, by letting a project rule publish state it
// reported against.

// answers every keystroke after it, against the import scope at the cursor —
// which a corpus built once per Program could never know.
//
// The inserted text is deliberately unclosed. `Insert` is verbatim with no
// snippet expansion, so the cursor lands where the text ends; `{@link }` would

// file context, so it cannot tell which claim owns the file the cursor is in;

// selectedCompletionUnits collects the units some configured reference selects,
// in the order they should be offered.
//
// Slice order is the corpus's only ranking channel, so it answers what an
// author cannot supply from memory. A heading's generated anchor is neither
// visible in the project tree nor guessable from its text, so selected headings
// come first; a Markdown file path is typed as easily as it is read, so file
// targets follow; Swagger operations come last, being both few and mechanical.
//
// Order therefore serves the author who is still browsing, and the filter
// serves the one who is not. No hint sets Label, so the editor lists and
// filters on the target itself: typing `docs/pricing` narrows to that
// document's anchors, which is the flow this ranking is for — an author writes
// a citation because they are implementing a document they have already chosen.
//
// Labelling a heading by its text would invert that. `sale` would match and
// `docs/pricing` would match nothing, two documents sharing a heading would
// become indistinguishable entries, and the listed text would stop being the
// inserted text — three costs to serve recall-by-title, which Detail already
// serves by being visible. Leaving Label empty keeps what is shown and what is
// written identical by construction.
//
// TypeScript units are absent on purpose. TypeScript's own language service
// completes symbols inside `{@link}` against the scope at the cursor, which a
// corpus built once per Program cannot know — offering one here would duplicate
// a correct list with a worse one.
