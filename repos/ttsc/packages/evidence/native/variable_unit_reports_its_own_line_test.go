/**
 * Verifies a variable declared after trivia reports its own line.
 *
 * A unit's line is taken from a position inside the declaration's own name, and
 * a variable unit is the one kind created from a bare binding identifier. An
 * identifier reports no name of its own, so it fell through to its full start —
 * the position the previous token ended at, which is a line above for each leaf
 * of a multi-line destructuring pattern and two lines above for a declarator
 * whose documentation block sits between them.
 *
 * Those are the two shapes where a reader cannot recover the position by eye:
 * a long pattern, and the block where a citation would be written.
 *
 *  1. Declare a first declarator, an inner one carrying a block, and a
 *     multi-line pattern.
 *  2. Collect the file.
 *  3. Assert every unit names the line it is declared on.

 * move an answer taken from a full start.
 *
 * What this cannot pin is the shape of the fallback below the identifier
 * branch. Every form here answers from its own name and never reaches it, and
 * no unit kind does, so widening that branch is invisible to the suite. It is
