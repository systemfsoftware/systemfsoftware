  // between it and the next heading, so a subsection's body belongs to the
  // subsection. A TypeScript unit owns its whole declaration text, which
  // **contains** every nested member's text, because that is what a declaration
  // is: there is no reading of `interface ISale` that excludes the members it
  // declares, callables included.
  //
  // So a nested change moves both its own unit's digest and every enclosing
