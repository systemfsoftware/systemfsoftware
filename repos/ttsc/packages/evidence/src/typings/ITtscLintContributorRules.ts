     * A review is an annotation of a citation, never an acknowledgement of a
     * unit. It discharges no coverage, contributes no host to `uniqueEvidence`,
     * and counts toward no `singleEvidencePerSymbol` total, so enabling this
     * rule cannot change a single `evidence/graph` diagnostic.
     *
     * The optional `#`-prefixed fingerprint token is carried without being
     * interpreted here. `evidence/graph` validates it against the cited content
     * under a reference's `requireReview`, which is what makes a review expire
     * when the thing it reviewed moves.
