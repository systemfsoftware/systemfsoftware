/**
 * A public TypeScript contract kind that can become an evidence unit or a
 * selected host for ownership evidence.
 *
 * The selector is intentionally semantic rather than a list of AST node names:
 * `"function"` includes the common ways a project exports callable behavior,
 * and qualified identities keep nested contracts addressable without adding a
 * file path to every target.
 *
 * - `"type"` selects exported interfaces, type aliases, classes, and namespaces.
 *   Enums do not become type units.
 * - `"function"` selects exported function declarations, exported `const`
 *   variables initialized with an arrow function or function expression
 *   (including parentheses and type-only expression wrappers), public instance
 *   and static methods of exported classes, method signatures of exported
 *   interfaces and object-shaped type aliases, every member of any of those
 *   three written as a callable (an arrow/function initializer or a function
 *   type spelled out), and the same callable forms exported from namespaces. An
 *   overload run is one unit. Constructors and accessors are not selected.
 * - `"property"` selects every member declared directly by an exported class,
 *   interface, or object-shaped type alias that is not written as a callable,
 *   plus exported `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations at module or namespace
 *   scope. A `const` initialized with an arrow or function expression remains a
 *   function; every other variable, including a function-typed declaration or
 *   function-valued `let` or `var`, is a property. A member is the one place
 *   that rule reads the other way, on all three containers alike: it is a
 *   property unless it is function-valued **or** annotated with a function type
 *   written out, either of which makes it a function. The test is syntactic,
 *   because this rule reads no type checker: `charge: () => void` is a function
 *   and `charge: Handler` is a property even where `Handler` is an alias of the
 *   same type, as are a constructor type and a union. Every exported leaf in an
 *   object or array binding pattern is a property. An accessor, including an
 *   auto-accessor, is neither, and a `private` or `protected` member is not
 *   selected whichever syntax declared it. A constructor parameter carrying any
 *   property modifier declares a field and classifies exactly as the same field
 *   written in the class body would, whatever the constructor's own visibility
 *   is, so a `private` or `protected` one materializes nothing, exactly as the
 *   body form does not. The property modifiers are TypeScript's own five:
 *   `public`, `protected`, `private`, `readonly`, and `override`. The last is
 *   the one to know about, because its meaning is about the base class rather
 *   than about the field, so it does not read as a field declaration. It still
 *   declares one: on a class extending one that declares `rate`,
 *   `constructor(override rate: number)` is a public instance field. A
 *   parameter property's citation belongs on the parameter: a constructor's own
 *   block hosts nothing, because two parameter properties would leave
 *   `@evidence` no way to say which field it means.
 *
 * TypeScript units form containment scopes. An interface or object-shaped type
 * alias contains the members it declares, callables included. A class contains
 * its selected members. A namespace contains every selected public unit nested
 * below it, including nested namespaces. An `@evidence` target, or an
 * `@evidenceExclude` target allowed by its reference policy, acknowledges its
 * selected node and every selected descendant. A reference selector defines the
 * obligation kinds while their unselected type ancestors remain addressable as
 * aggregate scopes.
 *
 * Top-level identities use the public export name, and namespace members
 * prepend their namespace, such as `Orders.create`. A namespace itself uses its
 * qualified name, such as `Orders` or `Outer.Inner`. A local declaration
 * exposed as `export { Local as Public }` therefore uses `Public`. A named
 * default declaration keeps its declaration name; anonymous and default-only
 * aliases have no stable target and are not selected. Members of an ambient
 * namespace are public without their own `export` modifier. A type-only alias
 * exposes a namespace or a class, its public type-space descendants, and
 * everything an object-shaped type alias, or an interface no class merges with,
 * declares, callables included, because every member of those two is
 * type-space. What it withholds is value-space: namespace data, namespace
 * functions, and every class member, the last because a member is addressed
 * through the class value the alias does not expose. An interface merged with a
 * class is withheld with it, since its members are reached through that same
 * value. Every type-only export withholds, in every spelling and across every
 * module boundary: an export list in the declaring file, an inline `export {
 * type Sale }`, and a re-export in any of `export type { Sale } from`, `export
 * { type Sale } from`, `export type * from`, and `export type * as api from`. A
 * member of an object-shaped type alias, or of an interface no class merges
 * with, uses `TypeName.member`, whether it carries data or is written as a
 * callable; one declared by an interface merged with a class is an instance
 * member of that class and uses `ClassName.prototype.member` like the body
 * form. Static class members use `ClassName.member`; instance members use
 * `ClassName.prototype.member`, and a constructor parameter property is an
 * instance member addressed that way. Computed names are not selected, even
 * when their expression is a literal. Literal names must be whitespace-free
 * because a declaration target is one whitespace-delimited token. A dot inside
 * a literal name is rendered unchanged; if that spelling collides with
 * qualification, the target is ambiguous.
 *
 * These targets deliberately omit file paths. If selected files expose the same
 * qualified target, a declaration using that target is ambiguous; rename or
 * further qualify the public symbols. A re-export whose declaration lives in
 * another file does not create a second unit in the barrel file. TypeScript
 * target characters are matched exactly; Markdown path-separator normalization
 * does not rewrite literal symbol names.
 *
 * Every supported public declaration described here may carry
 * `@evidenceExclude` when its file belongs to a claim, even when that claim's
 * selector omits its kind. The selector still controls `@evidence`; an
 * unsupported or unexported declaration carries neither form.
