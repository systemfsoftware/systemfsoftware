/**
 * The `@ttsc/lint` contributor that checks a project's evidence graph.
 *
 * Import this value into `lint.config.ts` and register it under the
 * `"evidence"` plugin name. You can then enable `"evidence/graph"` and pass an
 * {@link ITtscEvidenceGraphConfig} that describes which documents and TypeScript
 * symbols must remain connected.
 *
 * The plugin contributes five rules, enabled independently.
 *
 * - `"evidence/graph"` — the configured evidence graph. Every declaration target
 *   must resolve, and every selected evidence unit must be acknowledged. Takes
 *   an {@link ITtscEvidenceGraphConfig}. It also offers the configured targets
 *   as editor completions, on the cycles where it passes: the host publishes a
 *   rule's completions only while that rule reports nothing.
 * - `"evidence/singular"` — one public identity per TypeScript file, named after
 *   the file. Takes no options, so it carries a bare severity.
 * - `"evidence/documented"` — a JSDoc block on every selected export, which is
 *   the only place an `@evidence` tag is ever read from. Takes an
 *   {@link ITtscEvidenceDocumentedConfig}.
 * - `"evidence/todo"` — no remaining JSDoc `@todo` tag anywhere in a checked
 *   file, exported or not. Each tag is an unrealized contract reported with its
 *   own text, so the diagnostics read as the ledger of what remains to realize.
 *   Takes no options, so it carries a bare severity.
 * - `"evidence/review"` — an `@evidenceReview` beside every `@evidence` and an
 *   `@evidenceExcludeReview` beside every `@evidenceExclude`, naming the same
 *   target. The citation states why this declaration answers for a target; the
 *   review states what was verified, which is a different question nothing else
 *   asks. Takes no options, so it carries a bare severity.
