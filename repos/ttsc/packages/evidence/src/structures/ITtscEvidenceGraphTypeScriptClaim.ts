 * A population of TypeScript declarations claiming its referenced evidence.

 * public member an interface, an object-shaped type alias, or a class declares,
 * in each of the forms documented by {@link TtscEvidenceGraphTypeScriptSymbol}.
 *
 * Both `@evidence <target> <reason>` and `@evidenceExclude <target> <reason>`
 * require a target and a non-empty explanation. Ownership evidence must sit on
 * a host selected by {@link symbol}. An exclusion may instead sit on any
 * supported public export in the matching {@link files}, without changing the
