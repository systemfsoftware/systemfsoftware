 * and TypeScript; only the symbol selector differs, because its eligible host
 * kinds are a property of the language rather than of the claim.

 * host `@evidence`, so it extends {@link ITtscEvidenceGraphReferenceBase}

   * Declare it to gather them. An exclusion is the one acknowledgement that
   * reports an obligation discharged without anything being built, so reading
   * every exclusion a claim owns is a review that has to happen; scattered
   * through the population it means reading the population, and named here it
   * means opening these files. An exclusion selected from any other file is
   * reported where it sits, naming these patterns, and discharges nothing, so
   * its target still owes positive `@evidence`.
   *
   * The patterns narrow and never widen. They use the grammar and the root
   * {@link files} uses, and a carrier must already be selected by {@link files}
   * to host anything.
   *
   * This is independent of `noEvidenceExclude`, which decides whether one
   * reference accepts an exclusion at all. A claim whose every reference
