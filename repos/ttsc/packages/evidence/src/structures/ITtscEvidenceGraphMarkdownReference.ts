   * Omit this property to resolve against the active `ttsc` project root, which
   * is where every population resolved before this property existed.
   *
   * The value names one directory, never a glob. It may sit inside the project
   * (`docs`), above it (`../../docs`), or on an absolute path
   * (`/srv/contracts`, `C:/contracts`), and it may be a symbolic link or a
   * Windows junction to a directory, or sit inside one, which is read through.
   * A drive-relative Windows path such as `C:docs` is refused, because it
   * resolves against whatever directory that drive currently sits on rather
   * than against a stable base.
   *
   * Moving the root moves the addresses with it. With `root: "../../docs"` and
   * `files: ["requirements/**"]`, a section is cited as
   * `requirements/pricing.md#discounts` rather than through this project's
   * distance from the documents — which is what lets two packages sharing one
   * requirements set write the same citation, and why a shared population
   * declares its root once instead of spelling `..` inside every pattern.
   *
   * A diagnostic that asks you to correct this property quotes the spelling you
   * declared, while a file location beside it is spelled the way you would open
   * the file. The resolved patterns are published to the `ttsc` host as watched
   * inputs, so editing a document above the project still invalidates the
   * graph.

   * Every matching regular file is parsed as Markdown regardless of extension,
   * so exclude images and other non-Markdown assets from the patterns.
   *
   * These are globs, not regular expressions. `*` matches within one path
   * segment, `**` crosses any number of path segments, and `?` matches one
   * character. Both `/` and `\` are accepted as separators, while path identity
   * remains case-sensitive on every operating system.
   *
   * Patterns are evaluated from left to right. A pattern prefixed with `!`
   * removes its matches; a later positive pattern can include them again. The
   * array must contain at least one positive pattern.
   *
   * For example, `docs/*.md` selects Markdown files directly under `docs`,
   * while `specs/v?.md` selects names such as `v1.md` but not `v10.md`.
   *
   * A bare directory such as `docs` or `docs/` does not include its children;
   * write `docs/**` when the whole subtree belongs to this reference.

  /**
   * Whether this document is a checklist every selected claim host answers item
   * by item.
   *
   * Ordinary coverage asks its question once for the whole claim: has some
   * declaration, anywhere, acknowledged this unit. One host citing the document
   * therefore discharges it on behalf of every other host, which is right for a
   * requirement a single module implements and wrong for a document meant to be
   * read down a column — development principles, review rules, a release gate.
   * Set this where the question is whether _each_ host answered _each_ item.
   *
   * The denominator is the claim's complete selected host population, so a host
   * carrying no tag owes every item rather than being absent from the count.
   * Either tag answers an item: `@evidenceExclude` is how a host records that
   * an item does not apply to it, and pairing this with `noEvidenceExclude`
   * refuses that answer and demands positive evidence from every host.
   *
   * Two consequences follow and both are deliberate.
   *
   * A positive citation answers the item it names and nothing beneath it, and a
   * target naming no item at all is refused as an aggregate. Both halves are
   * needed. Under the default selector the document itself is an item, so
   * refusing only the unnamed scope would let one `@evidence docs/rules.md`
   * cascade through every heading and tick every box, which is the state this
   * option exists to end. `@evidenceExclude` keeps the cascade, because "none
   * of this applies here" is one reviewed decision however many items it
   * covers, and a host that does not participate at all should not owe one tag
   * per item to say so.
   *
   * Duplicate and conflict detection moves to the host. Two hosts excluding one
   * item, and one host citing an item another host excludes, are the expected
   * state of a checklist rather than a duplicate and a contradiction.
   *
   * Every acknowledgement is one host's answer, so a tag standing on no
   * selected host of this claim answers nothing here, and is reported where it
   * sits once nothing else consumes it. Carrier eligibility is wider than the
   * host gate, so the same tag may be an ordinary sibling reference's gathered
   * exclusion or an overlapping claim's own answer, and only a tag that
   * discharges no obligation anywhere is refused. The report covers a
   * declaration whose kind the claim does not select and one whose position
   * materialized no unit at all. `evidenceExcludeCarriers` is refused beside
   * this option for the same reason: gathering exclusions into another file
   * leaves every host outside it unable to record that an item does not apply.
   * Declaring `noEvidenceExclude` here lifts that refusal, since a reference
   * accepting no exclusion has none to gather.
   *
   * `uniqueEvidence` and `singleEvidencePerSymbol` are refused alongside this
   * one, at configuration time rather than as coverage failures. They are not
   * merely redundant here: a checklist requires every host to cite every unit,
   * which the first forbids the moment a claim has two hosts and the second
   * forbids the moment the population has two units.
   *
   * Pair it with `requireReview` to get the property a checklist is usually
   * wanted for. Each host's acknowledgement then carries the fingerprint of
   * that item alone, so editing one item expires every host's answer to it and
   * nothing else.
