// The canonical graph data model and tool I/O types: the wire contract
// `ttscgraph dump` emits and the MCP server loads, plus the schemas typia
// derives the tool surface from. Pure types so typia can build validators and
// tool schemas at build time, and so the Go `dump.go` writer has one TypeScript
// source of truth to mirror.
