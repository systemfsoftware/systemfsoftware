     * "Scheduler.tick", "Worker.run", "drainQueue"]`.
     *
     * Write them from the question, before you have seen a line of the code. A
     * codebase names many things alike, and the question's own words cannot
     * tell them apart: a question about _tracking_ matches the debug hook named
     * after tracking as readily as the function that does it, and one about a
     * _request_ matches a message listener as readily as an HTTP router. The
     * names say which you meant.
     *
     * Each is resolved like a handle — a symbol name, a `Class.member`. The
     * ones the graph holds take half the tour's entrypoints, the rest stays
     * with what the graph finds central, and a name it does not know, or knows
     * several of, is dropped. So a wrong guess costs nothing, and a specific
     * name is worth more than a general one: `drainQueue` resolves, `queue`
     * does not.
     *
     * Send `[]` when the question names no machinery — "show me the central
     * flow" in a repository you have never seen. There is nothing to
     * reinterpret then: the tour ranks on structure, which is what that
     * question asks for. Do not look names up first to fill this.
