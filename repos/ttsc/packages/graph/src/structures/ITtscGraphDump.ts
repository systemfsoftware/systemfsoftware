/**
 * The whole-graph export `ttscgraph dump` writes and the MCP server loads — the
 * wire contract between the Go fact-builder and the TypeScript graph engine.
 *
 * It is the complete graph with none of the per-response caps the MCP tools
 * apply: every node and edge the build resolved, plus the `provenance` that
 * says which program resolved them. The server parses each changed native
 * snapshot (typia-validated) into an in-memory resident graph and reuses that
 * warm model while project inputs stay unchanged; the bundled 3D viewer reduces
 * the same dump.
 *
 * `project` is the producer-local absolute locator. Every identity-bearing path
 * uses one schema-v6 coordinate relative to it: project files are ordinary
 * relative paths; same-filesystem siblings use `../` segments; package files
 * keep their full resolution context (including version/peer-store segments);
 * and a virtual compiler source stays `bundled:///…`. Raw absolute identities
 * are never emitted. A source on another drive or UNC share makes the producer
 * fail unless a future contract supplies a logical root for it.
