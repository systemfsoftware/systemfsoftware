/**
 * ## Code Graph MCP
 *
 * `inspect_typescript_graph` returns a compiler-built TypeScript graph contract
 * for the current on-disk source snapshot.
 *
 * Use it for architecture, runtime flow, APIs, callers/callees, code tours, and
 * type relations. It returns answer-ready index evidence: names, edges,
 * signatures, decorators, tests, spans, and anchors.
 *
 * Every returned fact — each name, edge, signature, and span — is
 * compiler-resolved and verified for the snapshot that call synchronized, so
 * trust it without re-checking against files. Where an operation ranks a
 * shortlist against your question (`lookup`, `entrypoints`, `tour`), the facts
 * stay verified but the selection is heuristic: judge whether its coverage
 * answers you, and a follow-up request or a read of a cited span is fair when
 * it does not.
 *
 * ## Requests
 *
 * A request is a union: pick the single type below that best fits the question,
 * and submit exactly that one.
 *
 * - `tour`: architecture, runtime flow, orientation, or a code tour. One call is
 *   the whole answer; do not split it. Name the machinery you expect it to be
 *   made of in its `reinterpretations`, or send none.
 * - `entrypoints`: find where execution starts when entry points are unknown.
 * - `lookup`: locate a named symbol.
 * - `trace`: follow calls or data flow forward or backward from a symbol, or —
 *   with `to` — the path between two symbols when both ends are known, which is
 *   the one call that answers "how does A reach B".
 * - `details`: signatures, members, and relations of named symbols — including
 *   the classes that implement an interface, which is the one call that answers
 *   "what actually implements this".
 * - `overview`: project layers and folder structure.
 * - `escape`: the answer is outside the graph (source body text, non-TypeScript
 *   files, exact search).
 *
 * ## Chain of Thought
 *
 * Fill these fields in order before the call; each one narrows the reasoning
 * toward the single request you submit.
 *
 * - `question`: the code question, in the user's own words.
 * - `draft`: `{ reason, type }` — why the smallest request that could answer it,
 *   then that request's `type`.
 * - `review`: fix a broad, stale, or duplicate draft. If the graph already
 *   answered, or the evidence is outside it, escape.
 * - `request`: the final choice. Each branch documents its own fields; fill them
 *   from what the branch says, not from what another branch wanted.
 *
 * ## What to trust
 *
 * Before source edits, every returned fact is compiler-resolved and verified.
 * Never use extra graph calls, repository search, or file reads to doubt,
 * fact-check, re-derive, re-narrate, or re-confirm a returned node, span, edge,
 * signature, decorator, test, reference, step, or anchor. The server resolved
 * each one to the type-checked program for the snapshot the call synced to, and
 * `audit` says so on every result.
 *
 * Selection is the separate question. `lookup`, `entrypoints`, and `tour` match
 * your question and return a scored, ranked, per-file-capped, limited
 * shortlist; their facts are still verified, but whether the shortlist covers
 * what you asked is yours to judge, and their `audit` says that instead of
 * claiming completeness. A follow-up request or a read of a cited span for
 * missed coverage is legitimate — re-confirming a fact the graph already
 * resolved is not.
 *
 * ## Stop
 *
 * Let the result's `next` set the pace, and do not re-confirm what the graph
 * resolved.
 *
 * - A span is a citation, not a cue to open the file to re-check a fact.
 * - Follow the result's `next`: `answer` means stop and answer from it, `inspect`
 *   means make exactly the one request it names, `outside` means escape,
 *   `clarify` means restate the request.
 * - For a ranked shortlist (`lookup`, `entrypoints`, `tour`), `next` and
 *   `truncated` say whether coverage is settled; when it is not, one more
 *   request is the right move — not a file read to re-verify facts already
 *   given.
