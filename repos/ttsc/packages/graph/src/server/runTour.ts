/**
 * What the tour says it is.

 * It used to say what it had _covered of the question_, and it could not know
 * that. The claim was decided by matching the question's words against
 * identifier names: a word the tour's own symbols did not spell, and for which
 * some symbol somewhere in the graph did, came back as a stage the tour owed
 * the reader — `inspect`, with the tool description telling the model to make
 * exactly the one request it names.
 *
 * What that string match actually found, on the corpus: shopping-backend's
 * question says "from request handling through auth, provider logic, Prisma",
 * and the tour reported "handling" missing on the strength of `handlePayment`
 * and `handleCancel`, two deposit and order helpers with nothing to do with
 * handling a request. Vue's says "a component/template read", and "template"
 * came back missing because the compiler's AST has a `TemplateLiteral`. Zod's
 * ends "the returned result", and `ParseResult.data` made "result" a stage. In
 * five of the eight project-specific tours the server reported a hole it did
 * not have and spent the model a call on it — and the drill-down started there:
 * shopping-backend's eight follow-ups open with the `lookup` this `next` asked
 * for.
 *
 * The failure is not a threshold. A question names concepts and a graph holds
 * identifiers, and no lexical rule bridges the two: "request handling" is not
 * `handlePayment` and never will be. The server cannot know what the question
 * means, so it cannot know whether it answered it — and the selection audit
 * riding in the same payload says exactly that: each fact is compiler-verified,
 * but the shortlist was ranked against the question and whether it covers the
 * question is the caller's to judge.
 *
 * So the tour states what it returned, which is a fact, and leaves what to do
 * with it to the reader, which was never the server's to decide. A tour that
 * misses what the reader needs is a tour the reader keeps asking past — and the
 * models do exactly that, without being told to.

 * insert flow that reaches the broadcaster, the metadata, and the driver fell
 * out of the tour entirely. Wide and shallow beat deep and few, and the model
 * went back to the files.
 *
 * So the surface is scored by the surface, and the body is answered when it is
 * asked for. The specific-flow lane wants the closures and gets them; the
 * orientation lane wants the surface and gets that. Judged by the answer rather
 * than the token count, the gated tour is the better one: it reaches the

/**
 * The tests that exercise the tour's symbols, nearest first.
 *
 * A subject is covered by more than one suite: NestJS's
 * `NestFactoryStatic.create` is called by three GraphQL end-to-end specs under
 * integration/ and by the unit spec that sits beside the code, and the tour's
 * slots went to whichever the edge list happened to hold first — the e2e ones.
 * So the model globbed the disk for `packages/core/test/nest-factory.spec.ts`,
 * which the graph had all along. A test that lives next to its subject is the
 * one a newcomer reads, so the anchors come back ordered by how much of the
 * subject's path the test shares.
